<h1 title=""><b>WHITE FIRE</b></h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE BEGINNING OF A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson started, then stared with
dilated pupils at a spot on the aluminum casting
before him. The spot, a jagged notch left by
imperfect work in the foundry, turned first a
dull red, then a bright red, then a glowing white.</p>
<p>Mechanically his hand touched the valve of
his oxy-acetylene torch. Yes, it was as he had
believed, the acetylene valve was closed. The
oxygen valve was open, it was true, but the
drum which had contained oxygen under a
thousand pounds pressure was empty. In fact,
he was waiting for the arrival of a new drum.
That was what made the thing seem strange,
impossible! It was a miracle, only miracles
don&rsquo;t happen in such places&mdash;he was working
in the heart of a great industrial plant which
turned out automobiles in twenty carload lots
and airplanes by the hundreds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Johnny scratched his chin and stared at the
white spot. True, the nozzle of his torch was
aimed at that spot; but five minutes before it
had sput-sputted for a few seconds, then died
down to an insignificant flame giving too little
heat for any sort of welding. He had cut that
flame off, yet now, before his very eyes the metal
glowed white hot.</p>
<p>With a grin which said plainer than words,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo; he thrust a finger in a can of
water, then held it over the glowing spot until
a drop of water fell.</p>
<p>Instantly he started afresh and stared with
wilder eyes. There had come the hiss of water
on white-hot metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot&mdash;hot enough to weld!&mdash;no doubt
about it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;What in the name of
all that&rsquo;s good?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Mechanically he lifted a light hammer and
struck four deft blows. The metal yielded to
the touch of the hammer as wax to the seal.
Still as in a dream he selected a bit of metal and
dropped it into the niche in the casting.</p>
<p>Watching it closely, he saw it, too, turn dull
red, bright red, then glow white. Again his
hammer fell upon the spot. Deftly he struck it
here and there until presently no trace of the
weld remained save the glowing white spot.</p>
<p>That, too, changed rapidly, first grayish white,
then light red, then dull red, then black.</p>
<p>For a time he watched it, then with a file he
brushed away the black scar, leaving the casting
perfect, ready to take its place in a splendid
chummy roadster.</p>
<p>A chummy roadster! For a moment, at
thought of it, Johnny&rsquo;s mind left the mystery.
It was to be <i>his</i> chummy roadster, and was to
cost him only a small fraction of what it would
cost on the market, for was he not of the salvage
department? And had not the head of that
department given him permission to salvage a
part here, another part there, and another there,
a few in the foundry, in the forge room, in the
electrical repair shop, here and there all over
the factory, until he had all the parts to make a
complete car, and was he not to pay for the car
just what the total value of the whole number of
parts would have been if they had been thrown
upon the scrap pile?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>A chummy roadster! It was the only bright
spot that had come upon his horizon since he
had returned home at the call of a telegram, and
had arrived to find his home draped in black,
with noiseless footsteps passing to and fro. His
father, the father who had been his boyhood
chum, had left him for other lands. He had
left, too, through no fault of his, a debt unpaid
and no estate from which to pay it.</p>
<p>To Johnny Thompson, who had had many
adventures but had saved no money, whose soul
was a soul of honor, this situation called for
but one thing: Adventures for him must cease.
He must settle down to hard work and clear off
the debt which clouded the family&rsquo;s good name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Dearly as he loved adventure, much as he
longed to be away to some untried wilderness of
Russia, Africa, South America, he had set his
teeth tight and had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my duty and I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a half hour he had permitted his mind to
dwell upon his thrilling experiences in Russia
with the &ldquo;Reds&rdquo;; in Alaska with Hanada; beneath
the Chicago river with Cio Cio San; with
Panther Eye and the wild beasts of the jungle.
All these adventures he had dreamed through
once more, then he had resolutely turned his
back upon them and had gone forth in search
of work.</p>
<p>Work was not easy to find. Times were dull.
At last after five days of fruitless search,
through the kindness of an old friend of his
father he had secured a place in the salvage
department of a great automobile and airplane
factory. This department took parts that had
been badly forged, or badly cast, and attempted
to make them perfect, to put them back into the
line of construction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cutting costs,&rdquo; the aged manager had told
him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after these days.
Can&rsquo;t afford to waste a move. And if you can
help us do that you&rsquo;ll soon be a valuable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance for adventure in sorting
rusty castings, I guess,&rdquo; Johnny had smiled,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll take the job; glad to. Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; the manager had smiled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer about that adventure stuff. You
can&rsquo;t always dope it out, but sometimes I think
that if a fellow is destined for adventure he&rsquo;ll
find it; yes, even in the heart of a noisy old
industrial plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had smiled and had at once forgotten
the remark. He had resigned himself to hard
and grimy toil, and for four months had stuck
with determination to his job.</p>
<p>Now that remark came back to him as if he
were hearing it again: &ldquo;If a fellow is destined
for adventure he&rsquo;ll find it; yes, even in the heart
of a noisy old industrial plant.&rdquo; Was this
strange white fire which enabled him to make a
perfect weld with no oxygen and with his gas
turned off, the mystery which was to provide
the adventure destined to come to him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>He stared about the deserted room. It was
after hours and no one was in the building save
Tommy Barr, who had gone for a new tube of
oxygen. He could discover no possible clue
which would tell him of the origin of the
strange white fire.</p>
<p>He started as there came a metallic click,
click. Then he smiled. It was Tommy rolling
the tube over the tile floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the funniest thing,&rdquo;
then he paused and turned the remark to another
subject. He had been about to tell of the
strange white fire. &ldquo;The mystery is mine,&rdquo; was
his sudden conclusion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll solve it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Tommy had gone for the night, with
trembling fingers Johnny selected a second defective
casting and set it in the vise as the other
had been. Eagerly he watched to see what
would happen. His impatience grew as the
moments passed, for no dull red glow answered
his invitation to the unseen source of magic fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess the spell&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>He waited a few minutes longer, then, switching
on the valves of his torch, he sent a touch
of blue flame against the defective casting and,
a few minutes later, threw the now perfect part
on the rapidly growing pile by his side.</p>
<p>After that he switched off his torch, snapped
off the electric light and went home.</p>
<p>Long before sleep gave his tired eyes rest,
however, he pondered over the strange doings
of the mysterious white fire, and well he might,
for as the days passed that mystery was destined
to become more intricately complicated, more
strangely baffling on each succeeding day.</p>
<p>Arriving at the factory, as was his custom,
a full ten minutes before work for the day,
Johnny, next morning, was surprised to find a
boy waiting for him with a message from William
McFarland, manager of and large stockholder
in the plant, his father&rsquo;s old-time friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he want, sonny?&rdquo; Johnny smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; jes&rsquo; wants to see you at the
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to do with that white fire,&rdquo; was
Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the industrial leader, motioning
him to a chair, &ldquo;when I gave you a job in
our salvage department you said something
about adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had some adventures,&rdquo; the magnate
scowled, &ldquo;that ought to have been profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how?&rdquo; Johnny stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t matter how I found out. The point
is you should have saved a lot of money from
the proceeds of those adventures. Apparently
you haven&rsquo;t. There was that gold mine in Siberia;
I&rsquo;m told it was a new Klondike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magnate held up his hand for silence.
&ldquo;There was also that bag of diamonds you
rescued from the head of the bolsheviki band.
Where&rsquo;d your share of all that disappear to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had any share,&rdquo; Johnny answered.
&ldquo;In that Siberian gold mine affair I was pledged
to pay over the profits to a relief committee
working with the refugees in Vladivostok. In
the case of the bag of diamonds, it belonged to
a defenseless Japanese woman and her people.
I returned it to its rightful owner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The magnate sat down. He was smiling.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of fellow I thought you were&mdash;a
son of your father. Know what broke your
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was too honest, too good to his employes.
Sold them stock when things were booming because
he thought it would be a good thing for
them. Then, when the slump came and the
stock went down, down, down, he bought it
back at the price they had paid. I think it was
a mistake. He thought it a point of honor. He
paid them the last cent and it broke him flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capitalist sat staring into space. When
he spoke again his voice was husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such men as that are rare. You&rsquo;re like
your father. That&rsquo;s why I took you into our
shop. I didn&rsquo;t need you in the salvage department.
I do need you now for a far more important
mission.&rdquo; He rose and closed the door.
&ldquo;I need you for a secret mission, one about
which you must not breathe a word to any living
being save myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>A silence fell over the room; a tense, almost
vibrant silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he put his hand on the boy&rsquo;s arm,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve a great discovery within the walls of our
factory, a discovery to which the formula, for
the time being, is lost. It is a new type of steel.
It has the hardness and the flexibility of the
Damascus sword blade and, like that wonderful
weapon, its owner cannot tell how it was made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what good will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McFarland again held up his hand for
silence. &ldquo;You know, in these days of keen
competition, manufacturers of motors for airplanes
and automobiles are bending every effort
to produce steel that will stand severe tests, that
will endure strains and over-drive, and will last,
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have such a steel as that, a marvelous
steel. The man who discovered it is a genius&mdash;one
of our mechanics. Unfortunately, after he
had produced a few bars of this steel, and before
he confided the formula to any other
person, or had discovered ways of working it,
he broke down from the excitement and over-strain.
His mind became a blank&mdash;a complete
blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to stare at the wall, as if in a
dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;are the bars of
steel, some only eight inches long, some two
feet&mdash;eight of them. Up to last night, that
is. Now two of the shorter ones are missing.
I was very careless. They should have been
guarded. Competition is very strong, and doubtless
a competitor has a spy in our plant. If
that spy makes away with that steel, if the other
man discovers the secret formula first and
secures a patent, you can see what it will mean
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked Johnny squarely in the eyes.
Johnny returned the gaze, but his knees trembled.
He remembered his experience of the
previous night. He had been the last man to
leave the factory. Was his employer about to
accuse him of stealing the precious bars?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>It was a tense moment. For a full thirty seconds
not a sound disturbed the room. At last
the magnate spoke in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, from now on it shall be your task
to guard the six remaining bars, and to discover
the whereabouts of the two that were
stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s muscles relaxed like a violin string
when the bridge falls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he leaped from his chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will. Now sit down there in
the corner for fifteen minutes and think out
some plans for discovering the lost property.
You don&rsquo;t need to tell me of the plans, but tell
me what I can do to aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight minutes had elapsed when Johnny sat
up with a start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like an
electro-magnet, a powerful one, leaned against
the south doorpost to the east exit. I want it
connected up with switches in such a manner
that I can operate it at a point where I can
watch the doorway and not be seen myself.
The electro-magnet should appear to be merely
stored there temporarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it attended to at once,&rdquo; said the
magnate. &ldquo;I wish you luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />JOHNNY&rsquo;S TRAP WORKS</h2>
<p>Closing time that afternoon found Johnny
in a cubby-hole just back of the main entrance.
He was peering through a crack which appeared
to have been left between the boards by accident.
It had, in fact, been made for Johnny&rsquo;s benefit
that very day.</p>
<p>He was watching the long line of workmen,
each swinging in his right hand his paper lunch-box,
file out of the building. A clicking, turnstile
gate allowed only one to pass out at a time.
The factory had other exits, but this was the
only one close to the spot where the strange and
precious steel bars had been stored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Beside the narrow board-walk over which the
single-file line traveled, lay a circular affair of
iron. Some three feet across and two feet thick,
it appeared but a crude lump of metal carelessly
left there. A close observer, however,
would have noted that electric wires led away
from the back of it. This was Johnny&rsquo;s electro-magnet.
When suspended in air from a cable
this innocent-appearing affair could lift a half-ton
of steel to a freight car platform as easily
as a child might pick up a handful of straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely that the fellow who took that
steel would attempt to take it from the building
at once. He&rsquo;d hide it in the factory and carry
it out some other night. Sooner or later I&rsquo;ll
get him. Sooner or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s thoughts were cut short by a hand
lightly laid on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d find you here.&rdquo; It was his employer.
&ldquo;Some things in the factory I want to
show you when the men are gone. They&rsquo;re
about out now. I&rsquo;ll just wait here. Don&rsquo;t let
me disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>But Johnny <i>had</i> been disturbed; his eyes for
the moment had been drawn from that passing
string of men and the electro-magnet. As he
again focused his eyes on the crack, he gave an
involuntary start. Clinging to the face of the
electro-magnet as if glued there, was an oblong
paper box&mdash;a lunch-box. And the man who
owned it? He had passed on out of sight without
any apparent attempt to regain possession
of his property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten luck!&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s lips framed the
words but did not say them. The trap had
worked. There was iron or steel in that box;
that was why the powerful electro-magnet had
drawn it to itself. He had recovered the property,
but his man had escaped. The precious
steel was safe. That much was good. He
heaved a sigh of relief; watched the last workman
march by, touched the switch, saw the box
drop from the magnet as the current was shut
off, then turned toward the door.</p>
<p>At this point a doubt came to his mind. What
if the metal in the box proved to be some other
metal than the precious steel? He had been
about to display his catch in triumph. He decided
to make sure first, and so merely said:
&ldquo;In just a moment I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Stepping outside, he secured possession of the
mysterious lunch-box and, carrying it as if it
were dynamite, again entered the cubby-hole and
said cheerfully: &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;m ready now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked slowly back into the factory
Johnny&rsquo;s eyes turned first to the right, then to
the left. For the time the baffling mysteries of
the hour were forgotten, and for the hundredth
time he was lost in admiration of this marvel of
modern industry, a vast manufacturing plant.
Here they passed through the forge-room where,
by the dull light of dying fires, one might see
trip-hammers, looming like giants, resting from
their labors. Now again they passed through a
sand-strewn room where crater-like heaps were
smoking&mdash;the foundry. And now they
emerged into the assembly-room, where were
automobiles partly put together, and further
down, airplanes poised like giant birds ready for
flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The things I am to show you to-night&rdquo;&mdash;the
voice of his employer roused him from the
spell which the place had put upon him&mdash;&ldquo;are
secrets, secrets known only to myself and two
other men. This factory was rebuilt and enlarged
during the World War. Our entire output
was then being taken by the Government.
In those days every precaution was necessary.
Spies of the enemy were all about us and in our
very midst, seeking out our most valuable
secrets, ready to destroy our plants and so cripple
our army. It was such a time as this that
I had installed in this plant the contrivances
which I am about to show you and which may,
perhaps, be of assistance to you. Your work
from now on will be done at night. You slept
this afternoon as I instructed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Then you will be all right for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy,&rdquo; answered Johnny slangily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here,&rdquo; they had paused in the center
of an aisle, &ldquo;please note your exact position.
Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s employer nodded approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a watch and flashlight? It&rsquo;s dark
where you&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No flashlight.&rdquo; In spite of his best efforts,
Johnny&rsquo;s knees trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a small one. Now prepare yourself
for a surprise. In five minutes stand up.
Watch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magnate reached up and gave a pull on
an electric lamp wire just above his head. The
next instant Johnny felt himself shoot rapidly
downward, to land at last with no perceptible
shock upon some flat object. All about him was
pitch darkness. At once his trembling hand
snapped on the flashlight. As its welcome gleam
shot out before him, he saw that he was in a
narrow, cement-walled chamber. One glance
downward and his tense muscles relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;The scrap-conveyor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>It was true. Beneath this up-to-date factory,
a tunnel had been cut, through which a broad,
flat conveyor ran. On this conveyor, from every
point in the factory, scraps of iron, steel, brass,
cloth, wire, rubber and what-not were carried
without the lifting of a human hand, direct to
the scrap-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a clever exit, nevertheless,&rdquo; thought
Johnny, &ldquo;and worth remembering. &lsquo;Five minutes,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;then stand up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Focusing the flashlight on his watch, he
waited. The conveyor was moving. He could
see the shadows of cement beams slowly rise
and pass by him. The place was fairly spooky&mdash;&ldquo;like
a tomb,&rdquo; he said to himself. It was dead
still, too. Nothing save the almost noiseless motion
of the conveyor broke the silence. &ldquo;What
a spot for a tragedy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;A fight
here in the night; the victor escapes; the dead
body is carried silently on to the scrap-pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One minute passed, two, three, four. The
silence grew oppressive. Five! Then came a
sudden flood of light from above him. Leaping
to his feet, he reached up to the edge of a
cement floor and vaulted up to it. Silently a
second trapdoor closed behind him. His employer
stood beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have a nice ride?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! A bit spooky, though,&rdquo; Johnny
grinned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you use it in an emergency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. It&rsquo;s the wire of the lamp hanging
directly above it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Works electrically. Pulling that
wire does the trick. There are some others,
though. We must hurry on. I have a directors&rsquo;
meeting at eight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The marvels, the tricks of magic which Johnny
witnessed during the tense half-hour that followed,
thrilled, charmed and at times frightened
him. Now he caught himself leaping aside, as
if to avoid the blow of a hidden force, and now
frozen in his tracks, he felt chills race up and
down his spine, while cold perspiration stood out
upon his brow. Convinced as he was that he
was in the hands of a friend, he could not fully
overcome the spell of this seemingly magic factory.
While standing idly leaning against a
wall, he would suddenly become conscious of a
movement in front of him, and there, not three
feet before him, a second wall towered. Whether
it had risen from the floor, dropped from the
ceiling or developed out of thin air, he could not
tell, so sudden and silent was its motion. Again,
he was standing talking to his employer and,
having been attracted by a sound in the distance,
turned away for an instant, only to find on
turning again to his friend that he had vanished;
the pillar beside which he had been
standing had swallowed him up.</p>
<p>After initiating him into the secret mysteries
of six of these strange devices, his employer
promised him more in the future, then took him
over to the front of a massive vault built into
the wall of the factory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Mr. McFarland, &ldquo;we keep our
most valuable tools and the diamonds used in
giving to shaftings their finishing touches. Here
also rest the six bars of steel of the mysterious,
unknown formula. We hope soon to rediscover
that formula, or that its inventor, through the
agencies of the doctor of the sanitarium, will
be restored to his normal mind and memory.
An old and trusted employe presides over the
vault during the day. It will be your task to
guard it nights. At any time you feel yourself
in danger, there are the secret doors, walls and
passages I have shown you. They may be of
great service to you in securing aid, if it is
needed. And now I must bid you good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s own voice, as if
coming from a cavern, sounded hollow to him.</p>
<p>As his employer disappeared from sight, however,
he shook himself and attempted to remember
something he had postponed, something of
which his subconscious memory was striving
to tell him.</p>
<p>Suddenly he started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box! That lunch-box caught by the
electro-magnet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant he was hastening away to
the cubby-hole where the box still rested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>As he put his hand to the door, a sinking feeling
seized him. What if it were gone? The
next instant found him reassured; with the
handle of the box in his own right hand, he was
hurrying back to his post of duty.</p>
<p>But what was that? Had his well-trained ear
caught the sound of a footstep? With heart
beating double-time, he stood in the shadow of
a great punch-press and listened. Yes, there it
was; a stealthy, gliding footstep.</p>
<p>Stooping, with a silent, tiger-like motion he
crept forward until the steel door of the vault
was within his view. There, in the shelter of a
milling machine, he paused and crouched motionless
as a cat.</p>
<p>He did not have long to wait, for out of the
shadows there crept the dark, crouching form
of a man.</p>
<p>Direct as an arrow the man glided forward.
Now he was ten feet from the steel door, and
paused to listen. Two steps more, and a second
pause. And now his hand was nearing the shining
metal knob that controlled the combination
lock of the vault. Again he appeared to listen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>At that second, Johnny&rsquo;s eyes fairly popped
out of his head&mdash;a strange thing was taking
place. The knob which had been white in the
semi-darkness, had turned a dull red!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysterious fire!&rdquo; he whispered, almost
aloud.</p>
<p>The next instant there came a strange hissing
cry of pain. The person crouching there, without
noting the red glow, had grasped the knob.</p>
<p>For a second he appeared to study the knob;
then, without as much as looking backward, he
turned and darted away.</p>
<p>Frozen in his tracks, Johnny stood staring at
the knob until the red glow had faded out and
the knob shone white once more.</p>
<p>A long time he stood there, his mind rife with
wild wonderings. What was this white fire?
Whence its origin? Johnny was not superstitious;
he felt that some human being was back
of it all. But that human being, was he friend
or foe? If friend, then he had frightened the
enemy away! If enemy, then he had known of
Johnny&rsquo;s presence and had used this means to
warn his confederate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Presently, when his mind was again composed,
he thought of the lunch-box and with trembling
fingers reached down to lift it from the floor.</p>
<p>What would it disclose? How would its
contents affect the mystery he was trying to
solve?</p>
<p>Johnny drew a deep breath, and grinned happily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />JOHNNY FLUSHES A SKULKER</h2>
<p>Trembling with suppressed excitement, his
brow deeply furrowed, Johnny lifted the lid to
the lunch-box, then stared in surprise and disgust.
The box contained, not the precious steel
bars of unusual and as yet unknown composition,
but a small twist drill, worth, perhaps, a
dime. For a moment he stared at the thing,
then picked it up and thrust it into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneak thief! Petty larceny of the pettiest
kind. But, anyway, I&rsquo;ll report it to the chief.
He may want to do something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The rest of that night, waiting in the shadow
of a gigantic sheet-steel press, in full view of
the vault where rested the remaining bars of
steel, Johnny saw no movement, heard no sound
that told him there were other human beings in
the building save himself and the regular night
watchman, who made his monotonous hourly
rounds, pausing only to punch a clock here and
there. But motionless and silent as they might
be, Johnny knew there were at least two persons
in that building who were there without leave
or license.</p>
<p>To attempt to run down a single individual
in the vast plant, with its labyrinth of aisles, with
thousands of machines, drill presses, millers,
forges, moulders, cranes, conveyors, with its
seemingly tangled mass of overhead equipment
and its endless underground tunnels, would be
equal to the task of capturing a fish with a
hand-net on the bottom of the Atlantic. To
discover the person would be almost impossible,
and even if he were discovered, his capture
would be difficult indeed. Only the best of good
fortune could crown such an effort with success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Johnny knew there were two men. One was
he who had attempted to tamper with the vault&rsquo;s
lock, and the other was the originator of the
mysterious white fire. That the fire was produced
by electric currents set to operate upon
certain given contacts, Johnny could not believe.
In the case of the knob to the vault&rsquo;s door, this
might be true, but in that of the aluminum casting
such a theory was impossible, for Johnny
knew there could have been no prearranged
electrical contacts.</p>
<p>The casting had been on the floor. Johnny
had lifted it to his vise and had clamped it there.
No one had been near it, save he himself, from
that time until the mysterious heat had enabled
him to do the work of repair by welding. How
could the heat have come there? That, he could
not tell. Who had created it? He could not
even guess. What had been the purpose in
either case? Was he friend or enemy? What
would be his next strange demonstration of
power? All these remained unanswered. Of
one thing alone Johnny was positive: The
person had been in the building and was there
still.</p>
<p>The thought made him distinctly uncomfortable.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he thought suddenly, &ldquo;if he is
our enemy, he has but to burn out the lock to
the vault and the door will swing open of its
own weight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Then he thought of himself. He had an uncomfortable
conviction that this heat might be
applied anywhere&mdash;on his own body, like as
not. At times he saw himself racing about the
factory tortured by an intolerable heat which
turned his garments to ashes and charred his
very flesh. At such times as these he rose and
shook himself free from disturbing fancies.</p>
<p>He tried in vain to remember any great discovery
which would make such intense detached
heat possible. He could think of none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a discovery! A great discovery!&rdquo; he
whispered at last, &ldquo;and the discoverer, instead
of bettering the world with it, is playing with it
just to make one person most awfully uneasy
and unhappy. And yet,&rdquo; he paused to think,
&ldquo;and yet he did send that chap gliding away
from the vault door as if his life depended
upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>In spite of all his forebodings, nothing further
disturbed the vast silence of the night, and
Johnny was ready, upon the arrival of his employer
in the morning, to make his report. He
had decided to tell of the lunch-box and twist
drill episode, but to say nothing, for the present,
of the strange white fire. He felt that
his employer would simply be perplexed and disturbed
by this news, without in any way offering
a contribution to the solution of the problem.
This was an affair which a single individual
might best work upon alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his employer, as Johnny displayed
the small twist drill and told how he
came into possession of it, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not, as you
have already suggested, interested in that sort
of thing. If there is a sneak-thief in our factory,
he will receive his just deserts in due
time, and that with no assistance from us. Our
factory is run on the honor plan. Every man
is put upon his honor. If he proves unworthy
of the trust, his fellow-workmen will find it
out first of all, and, since the honor of the
entire group is at stake, they will request him
to mend his ways or draw the pay due him
and leave. It is useless for him to attempt to
deceive them. He must be on the square or
get out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;it is probably
not a case of theft at all; it is very probable
that this drill was borrowed by the workman
for some work at home, with the consent of
his foreman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny blushed uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your plan, though,&rdquo; the manager hastened
to assure him, &ldquo;is a good one. Keep it up,
and you may catch something yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that we are
not interested in petty thefts. We are not.
This perhaps makes you wonder that you are
employed as you are at the present time. But
this is quite another matter. The taking of
those two bars of steel, insignificant as they
may seem&mdash;a few pounds in all&mdash;is of great
importance to us, since, as I have explained
to you, it may mean the revealing of a valuable
secret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The question of one&rsquo;s right to keep a commercial
secret is a delicate one. From a moral
standpoint it depends entirely upon the type of
secret. Unquestionably there are some secrets
which no one has a right to keep. Many great
secrets have been thrown open to the world
as soon as they are discovered. Radium is a
case in point. If our nation were at war with
some other nation at the present time, it would
undoubtedly be our duty to share our secret
steel process, should we be so fortunate as to
unravel all its mysteries, with the Government.
Since we are not at war, it does not appear
to be our duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law allows us to retain our secret until
it has been patented. However, if another
should discover it, we would hardly be in a
position to claim a share in the patent right,
since no one can prove that the other person
did not possess the secret first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will see then, that any person who
attempts to discover our secret can hardly be
classed as a criminal; he is simply playing the
game in a rather unfair way. There have been
secrets enough carried from one manufacturing
plant to another. Retaining one&rsquo;s commercial
secrets and reaping advantages from them is
part of the romance of business. You will
find few manufacturing plants, big or little,
but have their secrets. In one with the magnitude
of our own there are many secrets; the
one you are guarding is but one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny began, then hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what? Come on; let&rsquo;s hear what&rsquo;s on
your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s really one&rsquo;s duty to
give the whole world the benefit of his secrets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time, yes. But not at once, unprotected
by patents. We have spent a great deal of
money in discovering these secrets. We have
a right to get that money back with a fair
profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are ready to go on with the
search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Report to me when there is any
new development. Good morning, and better
luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the electro-magnet trap caught
nothing. Johnny went to work with a sense
of defeat disturbing his usually well-composed
mind. Had the two bars of steel been carried
at once from the factory, and were his well-laid
plans to come to naught? Would the steel
be tested and analyzed, the formula discovered
and patented by the intruder?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I can guard
securely that which is left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jordan,&rdquo; he said to the aged keeper
of the vault by day, as he came to take his post
for the night, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t they work that steel as
it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What steel?&rdquo; The old man gave him a
sharp look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Johnny smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the other laughed. &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t
seem to respond properly to the heat they have
tried on it; it crumples up like mud when they
try to work it. And when it comes to analyzing
it, there&rsquo;s an element or two they don&rsquo;t
understand. It&rsquo;s as if the stuff was from a
meteor dropped out of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought of these things on the watch
that night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a piece to experiment
with,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;This white fire,
now; I wonder how that would affect it. Fine
chance to try that,&rdquo; he laughed to himself,
&ldquo;First place, no steel; second place, no white
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week passed with no reappearance either
of the mysterious white fire or the stranger
who had attempted to tamper with the lock
of the vault. Johnny was growing uneasy. It
was true that his pay had been increased enough
to enable him to put away a generous sum at
the end of the week toward the paying of his
debt of honor. But the task was growing
monotonous, and, besides, there was no opportunity
to work on his chummy roadster that
was to have been built up from salvage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>But one dark night, when the wind was
banging at the steel-framed windows of the
plant, and rain beat upon the skylights in great
torrents, adventure came stalking his way in
the form of a crouching, skulking human who
made his way, all oblivious of Johnny hidden
by the shadow of a forge, to a dark corner
of the forge-room, where he rattled about
in a pile of imperfect forgings. He had just
turned and was about to skulk away when
Johnny&rsquo;s lips framed a word.</p>
<p>The word was not uttered, for like a flash
it came to him that in that particular spot
there was no opportunity to head the man off
and capture him.</p>
<p>He thought of the strange entrance to the
scrap-conveyor tunnel which had been shown
him by his employer. The conveyor was not
running. Once he had dropped down upon it,
he could stoop and run forward upon its surface
some two hundred feet. He would then
come out at a place in the direction in which
the man was going. In that spot a trick-wall
might be made to rise and head him off. He
would be trapped!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>A few silent steps and Johnny was upon
the spot above the scrap-conveyor. His hand
went up to the light wire. Straight down he
dropped. The next minute he was racing along
the conveyor.</p>
<p>At the end of this race he took a long breath
and waited. There would be a struggle, he
knew that. The best man would win; there
was no one to aid.</p>
<p>With a sharp intake of breath, he touched
a button, a trap flew open. With a leap he
cleared the opening and fell sprawling. His
estimate of time had failed him. The skulking
stranger had tripped over him and they had
gone down together!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />A FIGHT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was as nearly as possible
a perfect physical being. Having been taught
from childhood the necessity of physical well-being
and muscular prowess to the business
man as well as to the mechanic or professional
athlete, he had kept himself fit and had never
neglected an opportunity to learn some new
trick or turn on the wrestling mat or gymnasium
floor.</p>
<p>In the struggle that followed the collision
there in the dark aisle of the factory neither
Johnny nor the stranger had the advantage of
anticipating attack. Both had been surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Johnny soon learned that his antagonist was
no ordinary person. Seizing the man by the
feet, Johnny clamped on with a grip of iron.
But to his utter surprise the man gave the
sudden twist of a professional contortionist,
and came up between his own knees, clawing
at Johnny&rsquo;s face like a cat.</p>
<p>Loosing his hold Johnny made a sudden grab
for the other&rsquo;s waist, but in that fraction of
a second the man took a sudden double backward
somersault, and leaping to his feet, dashed
away.</p>
<p>Instantly Johnny was up and after him. He
was dashing along at full speed, making a good
gain at every leap, when of a sudden he banged
into a perpendicular wall. The wall was rising.
It lifted Johnny some four feet in air to dash
him to the floor again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fake wall!&rdquo; he muttered, astonished.
Had the other runner known of this trap and
had he sprung it? Or had it been an accident?</p>
<p>There was not a moment to lose. Dashing
back the way he had come, he rounded a pillar
and was again in full pursuit.</p>
<p>The stranger was now far ahead of him, just
rounding a corner to enter the loading-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Through this loading-room, which was a full
block in length and two hundred feet in width,
there ran a double railway switch. This switch
was filled with freight cars, some empty, many
loaded with raw material, bales of rubber-cloth,
bars of steel, bundles of wire. If the man
chose to lose himself among these cars the pursuit
was at an end. Johnny pressed on; there
was a chance that the great doors at the farther
end stood ajar, and that the man would attempt
escape at once.</p>
<p>As he rounded the corner, Johnny saw that
the doors were ajar and that, a third of the
way down the long unloading platform, a slim
figure was fleeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it. Got to try, though,&rdquo; he panted,
as he sped along.</p>
<p>Suddenly he became conscious of a chain
dangling just before him. It seemed to him that
there came a slight jangle from that chain.
Yes, now he saw it lift, then drop a foot or
two. What could it mean? Now it moved
forward a yard and stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>The chain was within his reach. Acting
from instinct rather than reason, he grasped it,
thrust his foot in the loop at the bottom, and
the next minute, with a grinding roar sounding
above him, he felt himself shoot forward at
a terrific speed.</p>
<p>The chain was attached to a huge traveling
crane. This crane, which was a steel beam
swung from wall to wall of the structure and
running on iron wheels along a steel rail set
at the very top of the wall, fifty feet above,
was electrically operated from a small cab that
hung just beneath it.</p>
<p>Johnny looked up at the cab. He could see
no person there. Darkness might account for
that, but all the same he felt a cold chill creep
up his spine. Was this, after all, a charmed
factory? Had he, all unknown to himself, been
moved to some enchanted city where heat, with
no apparent origin, melted metals, and where
giant cranes ground their way at express-train
speed with no one to guide them? He was
tempted to think so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>But cold reality brought him back to his
senses. Dangling from a chain, he was rapidly
approaching a man who was doing his
utmost to escape. What if that man were
armed? A wonderful target he would make,
dangling there in mid-air!</p>
<p>Cold perspiration stood out on his furrowed
brow. His knees seemed about to sink from
beneath him. He swung one foot free, and
began whirling about to give the chain a side-wise
pendulum motion that he might prove a
poorer target.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stranger did not turn to look
back. The very thunder of the traveling crane
appeared to lend new speed to his limbs. Perhaps
he imagined the entire place to be swarming
with men engaged in pursuing him. A
surprised look overspread his face, as Johnny,
not three feet to the right of him, swung past.</p>
<p>The man instantly dodged back and dropped
to the floor, but Johnny, leaping from his iron
swing, was upon him before he could get to
his feet again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>There followed a second struggle similar to
the first. This stranger <i>was</i> a contortionist,
there could be no question about that now.
Before three minutes had elapsed, he had again
wriggled like an eel from Johnny&rsquo;s grasp and
had dashed through the door to freedom.</p>
<p>In disgust, Johnny sat up and dabbed at some
scratches on his face which were bleeding.
&ldquo;Never saw anything like that,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>Above him the traveling crane hung in impressive
silence. He gazed up at the driver&rsquo;s
cab. All was motionless there. But what
was that? Did he see one of the landing doors
on the fourth floor open a crack, then close
again? He thought so, but in the pale moonlight
that streamed in through the windows he
could not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate seems to mock at a fellow sometimes,&rdquo;
he mumbled. &ldquo;Look at the luck I had, that
trip on the crane and everything, and then
look at the luck I didn&rsquo;t have; he got away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved a foot to rise, and something
jangled beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>He put out his hand and took up a bar of
steel. For a second he flashed a light upon it.
His heart beat wildly; the steel was blue&mdash;the
bluest steel he had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the stolen bars,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Lost it out of his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A careful search showed him that the second
one was not there. Then suddenly he remembered
that he was a long way from his main
trust&mdash;the vault where reposed the remaining
six bars. Rising hurriedly, he went racing back
to the center of the factory where the vault
was located.</p>
<p>Arrived at the corner of the forge-room he
paused and peered away through the darkness
to a point where a small light shone above the
vault door. He half-expected to see a figure
crouching there. There was no one in sight.
Once more the aisles of machines, conveyors and
tunnels appeared deserted. Strain his eyes and
ears as he might, he caught only the din of
the storm beating on the cupolas above the
forge-room and an occasional flash of lightning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Seating himself on a fireless forge, he leaned
back against its smoke conveyor and rested.
The double struggle, the race, the strange
occurrences of the night, had unnerved him.
He started at every new blast of the wind,
fancying it the move of some new intruder.</p>
<p>He was puzzled. Who could have been
present to give him that fast ride on the chain
of the traveling crane? Surely not a watchman;
these men knew nothing about traveling cranes;
indeed, few men did. The manipulating of these
huge burden-bearers, capable of carrying a
loaded box-car from one end of the unloading
room to the other, was a delicate and difficult
task. There were scores of levers and switches
to operate, scores of motions to memorize, yet
this man, whoever he was, had shown a competent
control of the massive machine. Who
could he have been?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>He thought again of the bar of secret-process
steel which he had now in his possession. Only
a few days before he had wished for a particle
of that steel that he might test it. Now he had
in his possession a whole bar of it, yet how
was he to secure a sample for testing? Only
a minute particle was needed, but how was that
to be obtained?</p>
<p>He was seized with a sudden desire to try
his skill on this strange metal. He had learned
a little of steel-testing while in the salvage
department. Not sixteen feet from the point
where he now sat there was a branch laboratory
for testing steel. All the equipment for testing
it was there. There was only lacking the tiny
particle of steel.</p>
<p>Taking the bar from his pocket, he turned
it over and over. He struck it on an anvil
and enjoyed the bell-like ring of it. He held
it to the light and studied the intense blue of it.
Never before in the history of the world had
there been such steel, he was sure of that.</p>
<p>Laying the bar down upon the cinders of the
forge, he took a little circle around the forge-room
to stand at last gazing at the door of the
vault.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Some faint sound caused him to turn about.
At once his gaze was fixed on the forge where
the steel bar was resting. The red glow of
fire was on the forge. The coal was on fire.
One end of the bar glowed with a peculiar white
light!</p>
<p>His first thought was that there had been
matches lying on the forge, and that they had
been accidentally lighted, setting off the coal.
This theory was quickly abandoned. Coal didn&rsquo;t
start burning that easily.</p>
<p>Then, remembering the old vault-keeper&rsquo;s remark,
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to take the heat right.
Gets all sort of crumbly when it&rsquo;s been heated,&rdquo;
he dashed for the forge, seized a pair of tongs,
and drew the piece of metal from the fire. It
slipped from the tongs and fell upon the cement
floor with a dull thud.</p>
<p>In an agony of fear lest the steel had been
ruined he seized a hammer and cold chisel and,
placing the edge of the chisel against the still
white-hot surface, struck it sharply with the
hammer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>A thin circle of steel coiled up about the edge
of the chisel, then dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter with that steel,&rdquo; he
muttered, as he watched the white heat slowly
fade to a bright red, then dull red, then black,
&ldquo;but one thing, I&rsquo;ll wager: That was our old
friend the &lsquo;white fire&rsquo; once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced about him apprehensively, as if
fearing to see glowing eyes staring at him from
the dark, but all he saw was a fresh flash of
lightning followed by a burst of thunder.</p>
<p>Looking down, his eyes were caught by the
thin coil of steel cut from the bar. It was cool
now and blue almost to transparency. He
picked it up and dropped it again, to see it
bounce ten inches from the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter with that steel,&rdquo; he
repeated.</p>
<p>Then a new thought struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&mdash;that bit of coiled steel is my
particle for testing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Touching the bar of steel he found it still
hot. Waiting impatiently for it to cool, he
paced the floor, his eye first on the vault-door,
then on the precious steel. What if he were to
be successful in his analysis of the steel? That
would be a great honor, indeed.</p>
<p>Retracing his steps to the side of the forge,
he once more tested the steel bar. Finding it
cool enough, he thrust it into his pocket, picked
up his bit for testing, and strode away to the
laboratory, where through a window he could
keep watch of the vault door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />A STRANGE TEST</h2>
<p>On a work bench before the window in the
laboratory there rested an instrument the like
of which Johnny had never seen before entering
the factory for work. The main body of
it was a black drum about a foot long and
ten inches in diameter. Out from this drum
there ran a tube which, bending first this way,
then that, passed into a bottle, then out of it
into a second, then out again and so on until
six or eight bottles had been included in its
route.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;This one catches
the carbon, this one, tungsten, this, water vapor,
this, iron, and so on. Guess the thing&rsquo;s all set
for taking off the different known elements
that are likely to be found in any steel. But
how about those unknown elements? Here&rsquo;s
a wild shot in the dark.&rdquo; Taking down three
bottles from the wall, he poured a little from
each into a fourth bottle. He then replaced
the three bottles and, by the aid of two short
tubes, inserted the bottle he had just filled into
the circuit running from the drum. Repeating
the operation with a new set of bottles he added
a second bottle to the circuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;if there are any strange
atoms floating around, those ought to give them
a home. Now for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing open a slide in the side of the drum
he adjusted his bit of steel in a position
between two electrical poles and directly before
a small nozzle. He then shut the drum, turned
on a switch which started a low snapping sound
inside the drum, turned a valve which set a
slight roar resounding within the drum, then
sat back to watch.</p>
<p>Presently a greenish gas could be seen passing
along inside the glass tube.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Working!&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Pretty slick arrangement!
Electric spark sets fire to the
metal, oxygen feeds the flame. Burn up anything
that way. That gas was the hardest, most
flexible steel in the world a moment ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sat there watching the process go
forward, hearing the hum and snap inside the
drum, now and then catching the roll of thunder
from the storm that raged outside, he thought
of the three Shakespearean witches and their
steaming caldron. He liked to think of himself
as a modern wizard with his smoking electrical
caldron.</p>
<p>But something caught his eye. The color of
the liquid in one of the bottles of chemicals he
had mixed at random was turning from white
to a dull brown as the gas from burning steel
passed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catching something!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Wonder
what it may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For ten more minutes he sat watching. Then,
when all the gas had apparently passed off he
turned the valve, threw out the switch, and
sat there lost in thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>It was interesting, this experiment. This
instrument had always fascinated him. He felt
that it might be that he had made a discovery.
But thus far he could go, no farther. Of chemical
analysis he knew nothing. Already he had
made a vow with himself that, as soon as his
debt of honor was paid, he would begin somewhere,
somehow, a study of those sciences which
were so closely related to industry&mdash;chemistry,
metallurgy, engineering, mechanics, physics.</p>
<p>But now he was stuck. He had never really
been given permission to work in the laboratory
alone at night and he was loath now to admit
he had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;probably nothing
to it, anyway. I&rsquo;ll just label you and put you
up here for the present.&rdquo; He scrawled a few
words on a label, pasted it to the bottle containing
the dull brown liquid, then set it upon an
upper shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;perhaps I&rsquo;ll have
the nerve to tell Mr. Brown about it, but not
now.&rdquo; Brown was the head of the laboratory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>He went out into the aisle and began walking
slowly up and down before the vault. He was
sleepy and tired. This night work was telling
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish it was over with,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to
show them this time,&rdquo; and he patted the steel
bar in the right-hand pocket of his blouse.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You say someone drove the traveling crane
down the loading-room and helped you chase
that man!&rdquo; the manager exclaimed next day
after Johnny had told the story of his queer
night&rsquo;s adventures. &ldquo;That seems incredible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only three men in our employ
who can run that crane and they, I am sure,
were not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny smiled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t explain it; all I know
is, it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a double guard on the place. Can&rsquo;t
have things going on like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Johnny smiled again. He had told of the
double struggle with the snake-like adversary,
of the chase, of the ride on the traveling crane,
and the recovery of one steel bar, but had not
mentioned the &ldquo;white fire&rdquo; nor the steel test
he had made. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he had asked
himself. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d understand a thing like that
&lsquo;white fire&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his employer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you recovered
one of the bars; I only wish you had
secured the other. One may do us all the harm
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw such a man,&rdquo; Johnny half-apologized.
&ldquo;Like an eel, he was, a regular
contortionist. I&rsquo;ve handled a lot of fellows, but
never one like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; Mr. McFarland reassured
him. &ldquo;You did better work than many
persons twice your age might have done. Well,&rdquo;
after a moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;you keep that bar
until this evening, then, when you go to work,
give it to Marquis and have him put it in the
vault. Your work will be as before until further
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Johnny was disappointed. He had hoped to
be relieved from this task, which would grow
doubly monotonous since it was definitely known
that the remaining bar of steel had been carried
from the factory. He managed to conceal his
disappointment, however, and went his way, to
sleep the day through with the bar of steel
beneath his pillow.</p>
<p>He did not return the bar to Marquis, the
day keeper of the vault, as he had been instructed
to do. When Johnny arrived he found
the vault locked, its keeper gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old precious one,&rdquo; he smiled, patting
the bar of metal, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s one more night in my
company for you, whether you like it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was that same night, in the long, silent
hours just following midnight, that something
happened that was destined to change the entire
course of Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s life. He was
sleepy&mdash;sleepier than usual, for his sleep had
been broken into that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I had another shaving off that steel
bar,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do that experiment
again, and try for a different result.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>As if expecting the miracle to repeat itself,
he walked to the forge-room and placed the bar
of steel on the little heap of coals at the center
of the same forge that had burned so mysteriously
the previous night.</p>
<p>Then with a laugh, which told plainer than
words that he thought he was kidding himself,
he turned and strolled away down the aisle
among the forges.</p>
<p>No room held such an endless fascination for
him as this forge-room. In the day, especially
toward evening when the outer light was failing,
when the forge fires burned brightly, and
the white hot metal on the dies glowed at each
stroke of the massive hammers, when the
whang-whang-whang of steel on steel raised a
mighty clamor, then it was a place to conjure
about. But even now, in the dead still of the
night, the powerful hammers resting from their
labor, the long line of forges with fires burned
out spoke to him of solemn grandeur and dormant
power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>He had just made the length of the room
and had turned about when from his lips there
escaped a muffled cry.</p>
<p>Instantly he broke into a run. Once more,
as on the previous night, the forge on which
the steel bar lay was a mass of white and red
fire.</p>
<p>By the time he had reached the spot, the
bar of metal was a glowing white mass from
end to end.</p>
<p>His first thought was to seize the tongs and
drag the bar from the forge to the floor; his
second was a bolder one. It caused his heart
to thump loudly, his breath to come quickly.</p>
<p>Dared he do it?</p>
<p>He put his hand to an electric switch by the
side of the trip-hammer nearest the forge. The
answer was a snap and a spark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Current&rsquo;s on,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I could do
it. Old McPherson taught me how when I was
in the salvage department&mdash;but dare I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>To the lower surface of the hammer was
attached a nickel-steel die. To the surface on
which it fell was bolted another. The two
matched. A white-hot bit of steel placed upon
the lower die at just the right spot, then struck;
then moved and struck again; moved and struck
two times more, would be no longer a clumsy
bar of steel, but a rough-finished connecting-rod
for an automobile. The white-hot bar of steel
before him was just the right length and thickness.
Dared he do it?</p>
<p>As in a dream, he seized the metal with the
tongs, lifted it, swung it about to the proper
position on the nickel-steel plate, touched a pedal
with his foot, heard the whang of steel on
steel, saw the hammer rise again, moved the
white-hot metal, touched the pedal, heard the
whang again; twice more repeated the operation,
then tossed the bit of metal, still glowing
white-hot, upon the sanded floor; a perfect connecting-rod
as to shape&mdash;but as to composition?
His breath came hard. Had the bit of
metal been spoiled in the heating and the forging?
And, if it had, how could he ever square
himself?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>To quiet his wildly beating heart he took a
turn about the factory, then returned to the
forge-room. He was just re-entering the forge-room
when something caught his eye. What
was it? Had his eye deceived him, or had he
caught sight of a furtive figure dodging behind
the sheet-metal press over at the right? In a
moment he would investigate, but first he must
make sure that the newly forged connecting-rod
of priceless steel was safe.</p>
<p>Quickly his heart beat as he lifted the now
thoroughly cooled steel, and allowed it to fall
upon the cement floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like real steel,&rdquo; he exulted.</p>
<p>He picked it up and examined it closely.
&ldquo;Not a flaw. And real steel&mdash;the best steel
on earth&mdash;and I forged it! But how?&rdquo; He
paused, a puzzled look overspreading his face.
&ldquo;How shall I tell them I heated it? What
good will one forging do with no means of
forging more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; he murmured, at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
them, anyway. And now,&rdquo; dropping the connecting-rod
in his pocket, &ldquo;the next thing is
something else. I wonder what it will be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>He left the forge-room and walked cautiously
toward the sheet-metal press.</p>
<p>As he neared it, a dark object, like some wild
animal leaping from its hiding-place among the
crags, leaped out, and away.</p>
<p>Who was this? Was it his contortionist-enemy
returned in hopes of retrieving the lost
bar, or was it some other intruder?</p>
<p>Johnny did not waste time on idle questions,
but sprang away in hot pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A WILD RACE IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>Johnny had not gone far in the pursuit of
the strange intruder who had leaped out from
behind the sheet-steel press, before he realized
that this was no ordinary runner. Not only
was he fleet and sure, but he was also nimble
as a deer.</p>
<p>Almost from the first it became an obstacle
race, a hurdle race, a long-distance endurance
race, all in one. Into the milling-room, where
were long lines of milling-machines and where
great quantities of unfinished parts&mdash;cam-shafts,
crank-shafts, gears and a multitude of
smaller parts&mdash;were piled close together, the
fugitive raced. Over machines and heaps of
parts alike he hurdled. Dodging this way and
that, he was now lost to Johnny&rsquo;s view and now
found again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Panting, perspiring, yet confident, Johnny followed
on. Knowing full well that when it came
to a test of endurance few men could outdo him,
he held to his pace, striving only to keep his
opponent in sight.</p>
<p>One thing puzzled him. In the tiger-like leap
of the fellow, in the swinging, crouching stoop,
there was something strikingly familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him before, I know that,&rdquo; he told
himself, &ldquo;but when and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the fellow shot up the cross-bars of
an inclined conveyor track which led to the second
floor. Suspended from a mono-rail above
this conveyor track was an electrically controlled
tram.</p>
<p>Was the electricity turned on? Johnny&rsquo;s mind
worked with the speed of a wireless. His muscles
did its bidding. Leaping to the platform of the
tram, he threw the lever back. So suddenly did
the thing start forward that Johnny was all but
thrown from the tram.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The next instant he caught his breath and
threw in the clutch. He was not a second too
soon, for had the tram traveled ten feet further
it would inevitably have struck the racing
stranger square in the back of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to catch him, not kill him,&rdquo; muttered
Johnny.</p>
<p>But the stranger was game. Leaping away
to the right, he dropped through a hole in the
floor in which there dangled a chain. Quickly
he disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Johnny followed, and, just as he touched the
floor below, heard the hum of an electric motor.</p>
<p>Johnny knew at once what it was&mdash;a &ldquo;mule,&rdquo;
as the workmen called the short, snub-nosed
electric trucks used all over the shops for light
hauling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t catch him on a mule,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>But again his face cleared. Just before him
there stood another of the trucks. &ldquo;A mule
against a mule,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see
who&rsquo;s the best driver.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>The race, while wild and furious, assumed an
almost humorous aspect; indeed, Johnny fancied
that from time to time the stranger turned about
and uttered a low chuckle. That was disconcerting,
to say the least. Added to this was
the growing conviction that he had met this
fellow before, and that under more favorable
circumstances.</p>
<p>All this, however, did not in one whit abate
his desire to win the race and capture the fellow.
Wildly the mules plunged on. Around
this corner, then that one, down a long row of
half-assembled automobiles where a single mislaid
tool in their track might mean a disastrous
spill, through a maze of trucks loaded down
with finished parts, now out into the open air
between buildings, now through a tunnel, they
raced. Now gaining, now losing, now dashing
through a short-cut and almost clipping the
end of the stranger&rsquo;s mule, now headed off by
a slamming door, Johnny gained, only to lose
again, until at last he came up short to find the
stranger&rsquo;s mule standing deserted in the heart
of the packing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where could he have gone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>It took but a moment for the answer. There
came the grind of the overhead tram. The tram
used for carrying fully boxed machines led to
the great loading room where Johnny had lost
his other race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he makes it, he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Leaping out
and up, Johnny caught the platform of a second
tram; he drew himself up, threw in the
lever and was once more in the race.</p>
<p>At last fortune was favoring him. The door
to the loading-room was locked. The stranger
was running himself into a narrow passage from
which escape would be impossible. Johnny
leaped from his tram, to find the stranger facing
him. That person was clearly on the defense.
With fists doubled up he advanced to
attack.</p>
<p>Just as the stranger struck out with his right
hand, Johnny ducked low&mdash;so low that the
other&rsquo;s blow glanced harmlessly over his head.
The next instant Johnny would have come up
with a &ldquo;haymaker,&rdquo; had not the stranger
thrown himself, stomach down, on Johnny&rsquo;s
back, and turned a quick somersault forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Whipping himself about, prepared for another
wild race, Johnny was astonished to find
the stranger standing smiling at him, and extending
his hand;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Johnny, old boy!&rdquo; the other
grinned. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t lost a bit of your pep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the best of me,&rdquo; Johnny smiled
doubtfully, &ldquo;but if you ever had any more pep
yourself, I&rsquo;d hate to have followed you far!&rdquo;
He mopped his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recognize me, eh? Perhaps you miss
the blue goggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Johnny stared. &ldquo;What? Not
my old pal, Panther Eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; smiled the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been working here for a month. Got a way
of getting in when I want to. Thought I&rsquo;d
make you an early morning call. Whew! you
sure gave me a merry chase! Good of you
though not to knock my head off with that tram.
&rsquo;Fraid you&rsquo;ll never make an ideal guard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never be a guard at all if I had my way.
But what&rsquo;d you run for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wanted to see how much you had in
you,&rdquo; chuckled Panther Eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you did! Well, you saw, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other admitted, taking his turn
at mopping his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed, &ldquo;since it&rsquo;s only
you, I&rsquo;ve got to get back to my post. Got some
cakes and a little ice-cream in the bottom of
a freezer from the company cafeteria. Want
to join me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>As they made their way back through the
maze of machinery to the vault, Johnny was
busy with his own thoughts. Strange questions
kept rising in his mind. This fellow, Panther
Eye, or &ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; as the boys called him for
short, had been with him in many an adventure.
He had appeared to possess strange powers,
too. The boys had called him &ldquo;Panther
Eye&rdquo; because he appeared to have the power
to see in the dark. There had been a time when
Johnny had been with him in a cave dark as a
dungeon, surrounded by hostile natives, yet
Pant had somehow known that the natives were
there, and had led the way through the dense
darkness to safety. There had been other times&mdash;many
of them&mdash;in which Pant had made
Johnny a heavy debtor to him through his use
of wonderful powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Johnny was wondering, &ldquo;just how
much has he to do with the events of the last
few days? He&rsquo;s too honorable a fellow to have
anything to do with the attempt to secure the
secret-process steel for some other manufacturer.
But how about the white fire? What of
the driving of the traveling crane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he closed his mental questionings with
a sigh. He had never asked Pant to reveal
any of his secrets and he was not going to begin
now.</p>
<p>Soon they were feasting on ice-cream and
cake and talking over old times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Johnny, as dawn began
to break, &ldquo;have you ever met Mr. McFarland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say not!&rdquo; grinned Pant. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the manager,
ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Want to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try it once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Soon&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m relieved from duty
we&rsquo;ll wander around to his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chum of yours, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. But I&rsquo;m working under his orders.
Got something to turn in this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny showed him the connecting-rod made
of the strange blue steel. &ldquo;Made that myself,&rdquo;
Johnny said proudly.</p>
<p>A peculiar smile played about Pant&rsquo;s lips,
but he said never a word.</p>
<p>When Pant had been introduced to the manager,
as one of Johnny&rsquo;s oldest and best friends,
who happened to be working at the plant, Johnny
produced the connecting rod, and, with trembling
fingers, handed it to the manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; A puzzled expression came
into the manager&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Connecting-rod made of the new-process
steel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Can&rsquo;t be! That steel won&rsquo;t work!
Nobody knows how. But&mdash;&rdquo; He paused to
look more closely&mdash;&ldquo;but it is! Say! Do you
know how to work it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Johnny said regretfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how was it made? Where did you
get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny sat down and this time told the story
of the white fire through from the beginning.
Only one thing he did not tell: He did not tell
of testing the steel in the laboratory and of the
bottle of brownish liquid on the top shelf.</p>
<p>The manager listened with rapt attention,
now and then ejaculating: &ldquo;Never heard of
such a thing! Can&rsquo;t believe it unless I see it
myself! Impossible, young man! Impossible!
Can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the forging to prove it,&rdquo; insisted
Johnny stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
willing to lose a night&rsquo;s sleep over it, or part of
one at least. We&rsquo;ll try the thing out. We&rsquo;ll
see if the ghost walks to-night,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take out two of the long bars in the
vault and one of the short ones. We&rsquo;ll put
them on the forge and&mdash;and if the fire comes
and they get white-hot, we&rsquo;ll cut the two long
bars in half, and hammer four connecting-rods
from them and one from the short one. That
will give six with this one you have, making a
full set for one of our chummy roadsters. Can
you drive a car?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. If the ghost walks to-night, it&rsquo;s
a trip clear across the continent for you&mdash;all
the way to the Golden Gate and back again!
What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;say all right,&rdquo; stammered Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; warned Mr. McFarland, shaking
his finger at Johnny, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s providing the
white fire comes. But, pshaw! it won&rsquo;t. Whoever
heard of such a thing? But, anyway, I&rsquo;ll
be around at nine sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I bring Pant?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like&mdash;providing the ghost doesn&rsquo;t
object.&rdquo; The manager laughed again, and the
two boys walked out.</p>
<p>That night, when the perpetual din of trip-hammers,
riveters, millers, and general construction
machinery was stilled, and the plant
had taken on a hushed and seemingly expectant
air, the three, Mr. McFarland, Johnny and
Pant, gathered in the corner of the forge-room.</p>
<p>The manager seemed nervous. His hand
trembled slightly as he placed the three steel
bars on the forge.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s brow was wrinkled. He was worried.
He was fearful that the experiment would
not work. Indeed, he had little hopes that it
would. And he did want it to, for success meant
the chance to get away from his monotonous
task, as well as a glorious cross-continent trip.</p>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s face wore the old mask-like look that
Johnny had seen on it so many times before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I take it,&rdquo; smiled the manager, &ldquo;that
the formula is to place the bars of steel on the
forge, then turn your back and walk away. Always
must go according to formula when dealing
with ghosts,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Are you ready?
I have placed the bars in position. All right.
We&rsquo;re off! Remember, no looking back!&rdquo;
Slowly, solemnly, they marched to the end
of the forge-room, then turned about. Johnny&rsquo;s
heart was beating violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed the manager, &ldquo;your
friend isn&rsquo;t with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. Pant had disappeared. Before
Johnny could make a guess as to what had become
of him, there came another exclamation
from Mr. McFarland:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s working!&rdquo; There was awe in his voice.</p>
<p>Johnny stared for a second, then started on
the run. He was closely followed by his employer.
The bars, already glowing red, had
turned to almost a white heat by the time they
reached the side of the forge.</p>
<p>The manager had been an expert forge man
long before he became a capitalist. He now took
charge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;One thing at a
time. First we&rsquo;ll cut those bars in two. A
chisel edge on that anvil there. That&rsquo;s right.
There you are. Now forge that one while I cut
the other one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whang-whang-whang went the hammer. One
perfect connecting-rod. Whang-whang-whang&mdash;another.
Three times more, then with perspiration
standing out on their faces, Johnny
and his employer sat facing one another while
the connecting-rods cooled. To Johnny it seemed
that they must resemble nothing quite so much
as two puppies, who, after succeeding in killing
a rat, sit on their haunches to grin at one
another.</p>
<p>Suddenly Johnny sprang up;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Here&rsquo;s Pant,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Where
you been? Look what we&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; He pointed
at the forgings.</p>
<p>Pant smiled a strangely noncommittal smile.
&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;happened to think of something,&rdquo;
was all he said. There was again that teasing
smile about the corners of his mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;d like to know more about
that transcontinental auto trip,&rdquo; smiled Johnny,
turning to his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night. All the details are not worked
out yet. Besides, it&rsquo;s late, and old fellows like
me belong in bed. But I want to congratulate
you.&rdquo; He put out his hand. Johnny shook it
warmly. &ldquo;The more I think of it, Johnny, the
more I&rsquo;m inclined to think your ghost is a scientific
enigma.&rdquo; With a nod to Pant which might
have meant merely &ldquo;good night&rdquo; and which
also might have indicated something more mysterious,
he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mr. McFarland, as Johnny
took the chair by his desk next morning, &ldquo;you
helped us to speed things up quite a bit by getting
those connecting-rods forged. This new
steel must be tested out in actual service. Even
had we the formula, this would be true. Now,
with this set of connecting-rods in our possession,
we are in a position to give the steel a
thorough testing out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My proposition is this,&rdquo; he wheeled about,
and leveled his eyes upon Johnny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
get those connecting-rods milled down to the
shape and surface needed, if we have to use
diamond millers to do it. When they are in
perfect shape, we&rsquo;ll put them into one of our
chummy roadster engines, and you take that
roadster across the continent and back again to
test them out. What do you say to that?&rdquo; His
face broadened into a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be some trip,
but by George you deserve it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not appear to share fully in his
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to
do it. It would be a wonderful experience, but&mdash;but
there&rsquo;s that chummy roadster I was salvaging
and was to have at cost. It&rsquo;s two-thirds
done. It will mean a long wait. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to
finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the manager, stroking his chin.
&ldquo;You want a car of your own&mdash;that&rsquo;s natural.
I suppose most boys do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; Johnny hesitated, then added:
&ldquo;Not that at all, sir. I want to finish it to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sell it?&rdquo; His employer stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! I have a debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A debt?&rdquo; The manager&rsquo;s eyes registered
disapproval. &ldquo;A boy of your age shouldn&rsquo;t have
debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny got red in the face, hesitated a moment,
then blurted out: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my debt. My
father&rsquo;s debt, but one he would have paid every
cent of had he lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s debt?&rdquo; the manager asked
with a curious change of tone. &ldquo;Yes, he would
have paid it. I believe you. And you want to
pay by selling the car you have salvaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; part of it.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were
upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you shall. You shall pay it. But
just now we need you for this new service. Can
you trust me to see that your affairs come out
all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Johnny looked him in the eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Be back in my office here at this
time day after to-morrow. In the meantime,
you are on your own.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing more,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;This fellow Pant is an old friend of mine; he&rsquo;s
seen me through a lot of things. Any objection
to his going along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever. He&rsquo;ll be a help to you, and
between you, you must guard the car well, for
you must not for one minute forget that it contains
almost our entire supply of the precious
new steel, and that as yet we do not know the
formula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our best,&rdquo; said Johnny, as he pulled
on his cap and left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />A RACE ACROSS THE DESERT</h2>
<p>Johnny was puzzled and not a little worried.
The chummy roadster, equipped with connecting-rods
of the new steel, which had carried them
seven thousand miles without a mishap, lunged
first to one side of the road, then to the other.
It leaped forward to bury itself in a cloud of
dust that lay deep as mud on the desert trail.
To the right and left of them and before them,
far as eye could see, was sagebrush. The air
was permeated with the odor of it.</p>
<p>They were two hundred miles from anywhere,
in the heart of the Great American Desert, and
behind them, like a streak of fire, a long, low
red car was bearing down upon them. It was
this car that puzzled and worried him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t give her more gas, can you?&rdquo; Pant
asked hoarsely. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gaining fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Pushing the dusty goggles up from the ridge
of his nose, Johnny stared ahead. There never
was another such trail. In a land where rain
never falls the roads rut, and the ruts fill with
dust. Cars sink in to the axles, and skidding,
shoot to the other side, to fall into a deeper rut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go faster is suicide,&rdquo; Johnny groaned.
&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;ll have to be a fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty uneven one, too, probably,&rdquo; Pant
muttered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop till I tell you to; I&rsquo;m
getting into the back seat to have a look at
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping the seat he made his way, tossed
first this way, then that, to the back of the car.
There he remained with eyes fixed on the back
trail.</p>
<p>Rapidly Johnny ran over in his mind the circumstances
which led up to this moment. He
had gone to the manager&rsquo;s office at the time appointed,
and there had been given the car,
equipped with the strangely valuable connecting-rods.
He had been instructed to draw on the
company for expense money when necessary, to
report progress once a week, to make his way
to the Pacific coast and back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>The outgoing journey had been wonderful.
The speeding across broad plains, between waving
fields of grain, the climbing of the Rocky
mountain and Cascade passes, circling up and
up and up, with here a yawning canyon hundreds
of feet beneath them, and here, not a hundred
feet above them, one of those perpetual
banks of snow; all this had given Johnny a new
vision of the grandeur and beauty of his native
land.</p>
<p>The return trip had been uneventful until they
had reached the western edge of the Great
American Desert. There in a garage, where
they had left their car for a change of tires and
to secure a box lunch to take with them in crossing,
they had seen a man who roused Johnny&rsquo;s
suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that fellow?&rdquo; he had asked of
Pant, as they left the garage, &ldquo;the chap standing
by the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some bird!&rdquo; Pant had chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a gigantic frog,&rdquo; Johnny had
smiled. &ldquo;Did you notice what prodigiously long
fingers he had, and what spindly legs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet he could scratch his ear with his big
toe all right,&rdquo; Pant had laughed. &ldquo;Some contortionist,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;contortionist&rdquo; Johnny had
started. He recalled his struggle back there in
the factory with the fellow who appeared to
have all the strange characteristics of a contortionist.
So strong was the resemblance between
this man and the one back in the garage he was
tempted to turn back.</p>
<p>But he had called himself fanciful and foolish,
and had gone on with Pant for their lunch.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the garage, however, his
first thought was of the car. The instant his
eyes fell upon it a quick exclamation had escaped
his lips, and he bounded forward.</p>
<p>Dressed in a suit of unionalls, and bending
over the engine, had been the slim stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Johnny had demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tunin&rsquo; her up a bit. Why? What&rsquo;s worry&rsquo;n&rsquo;
yuh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny eyed the stranger angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our car. We didn&rsquo;t order any work
done in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your car?&rdquo; The other had straightened up
in amazement, real or cleverly pretended.
&ldquo;Why, then I&rsquo;m workin&rsquo; on the wrong jitney!
Beg your pardon. I&rsquo;ll put her back in shape.
Won&rsquo;t take but a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tend to it myself,&rdquo; Johnny had said
rather shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right, brother. No quarrel about
that!&rdquo; The stranger had gathered up his tools
and had backed away.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart had skipped a beat when he
saw how close a shave it had been; two of the
connecting-rods were all but free from their
fastenings, and the others might have been in a
few moments more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have him pinched,&rdquo; he grumbled,
&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the use. They&rsquo;d say we were crazy.
You can&rsquo;t tell them the whole truth, and you
can&rsquo;t have a man arrested for working on the
wrong car by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Pant nodded a sympathetic assent.</p>
<p>They had taken the desert trail with many
misgivings. This roaring red demon behind
told them that their fears were well founded.
They did not know how many men there were in
the car, but there were probably two to their
one, and the other men were doubtless heavily
armed. There could be no doubting their purpose.
They were after the steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks bad!&rdquo; Johnny groaned, as he braced
himself in the seat and prepared to give the car
three more notches of gas, hoping against hope
the meanwhile that they would heave in sight of
some sheep-herder&rsquo;s shack or some truck caravan
coming from the other direction. Well he
knew that, on this unfrequented road, the chance
was slight.</p>
<p>They were speeding up. The car swayed
from side to side like a drunken man. It tossed
this way and that like a ship in a high sea. Now
they careened to the right, and, running on two
wheels, plunged madly forward, to swing back
and go whirling to the left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>All this time Johnny, with hands grimly gripping
the wheel, with eyes glued upon the road,
was, in his subconscious mind, counting the cost.
It had been his chance. Now he was going to
lose. He had hoped that this trip would mean
much toward wiping out his debt of honor.
That was all over now. He had made, he hoped,
a good impression on his employer. This, too,
would be forgotten. With the valuable steel
parts stolen, the work of their weeks of travel
would be lost. The secret formula, too, might
be discovered. And all this because he had not
taken precaution to see that the wily stranger
was clear of the neighborhood before they
started across the desert.</p>
<p>A hill loomed ahead. The slight climb ended
in a broad, flat plateau. Here the alkali dust
disappeared. Straight, hard and smooth for a
mile, perhaps two miles, the road stretched.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart gave a bound of hope. What
was beyond the brow of that plateau?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>All this time his mind was wandering back
to Pant. Sitting there silently in the back seat,
his eyes glued upon the road, he seemed oblivious
to all else. There had been a time when
Johnny would have considered him equal to the
task of stopping the pursuers by some magic
power. By the flash of a crimson light, which
appeared to come from his very eyes, he had
seen him stop a hungry tiger stalking its prey.
But those were the days in which Pant wore a
cap pulled well down and a pair of immense
black goggles. There had been mystery behind
this cap and those goggles. Pant without them
seemed shorn of his magic power, like Samson
when shorn of his hair.</p>
<p>Down the smooth, straight stretch of road
they sped, and for one mile at least the red
demon gained not one single yard.</p>
<p>But as they reached the end of that plateau,
grim despair gripped the boy&rsquo;s heart. Far and
away lay only the uneven volcanic ash and the
sagebrush. Not a house, not an automobile,
not a cattleman&rsquo;s pony dotted the landscape,
and from this promontory one might see miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well wreck her.&rdquo; Johnny ground
his teeth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck here. If they catch
us they&rsquo;ll strip her, and you can&rsquo;t run a car
without connecting-rods. Old boat,&rdquo; he
groaned, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stick to the trail till we crash
or they run us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car gave a lurch, all but turned over,
righted itself and shot down the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Johnny caught Pant&rsquo;s voice at his
elbow. &ldquo;Guess you can ease up a bit now.
No use takin&rsquo; too many chances. I think by the
looks of it, their car&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny slowed down, then looked back. He
could not believe Pant. He looked again. It
was true; above the dull brown cloud of dust
was a white and black cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be the sagebrush?&rdquo; said Johnny,
rubbing his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Pant, climbing back
into the front seat. &ldquo;Sagebrush wouldn&rsquo;t
make that kind of smoke; besides, it&rsquo;s green
and wouldn&rsquo;t burn.&rdquo; The car bumped along at
a milder pace. The red demon, now unmistakably
ablaze, reached the crest of the plateau
and stopped. Men swarmed out of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Four of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Pant chuckled. &ldquo;Fine
chance we&rsquo;d have had against &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re waving at us,&rdquo; said Johnny, after
a glance over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em wave. Think we&rsquo;re green, I guess.
Expect us to come right back and play things
into their hands. Be a car or something along
here to-day or to-morrow, sure. Won&rsquo;t hurt
&rsquo;em to eat dust awhile. That&rsquo;s the job they
meant to give us, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten miles farther on they stopped for lunch.
As Johnny drew the lunch-box from beneath
the back seat, he noticed a long, slim leather
case lying on the floor of the car. As he picked
it up, he was astonished at the weight of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Pant?&rdquo; he asked in a surprised
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? Why that&rdquo;&mdash;Pant seemed unduly
excited&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a little emergency case I
always carry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>He put out his hand for it, and having it, at
once fastened it to his belt beneath his jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency case?&rdquo; thought Johnny. &ldquo;I
wonder what kind.&rdquo; But as usual he asked no
questions.</p>
<p>He was destined to remember that case and
the unusual circumstances of the burning car
many days later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />THE DUST-EATING MULE</h2>
<p>The long, dark corridors of the vast automobile
and airplane factory were silent. The
same old ponderous machines loomed here and
there, while smaller ones stood sentry everywhere.
At the end of one long alleyway a
small light gleamed. Flickering first to the
right, then to the left, it cast gigantic shadows
against the walls.</p>
<p>Two boys were working over a &ldquo;mule.&rdquo; A
mule in a factory, as you will remember, is one
of those hard-working, snub-nosed little motors
that drag trucks about from department to
department. The boys were working over the
motor of this mule. There came now and then
the metallic clink of a wrench, or the tap tap
of a hammer, followed by a grunt of satisfaction
or disgust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Johnny Thompson straightened
up and stretched his cramped muscles. &ldquo;I
guess she&rsquo;s about ready to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip across-continent and the return had
been accomplished. Aside from the stirring
adventure on the desert, they had met with no
unusual experiences. The connecting-rods,
struck from the steel of mysterious composition,
had performed wonderfully well. When
measured by instruments that were exact to
the ten-thousandth part of an inch, it had been
found that they had worn down only thirty-four
ten thousandths of an inch, while connecting-rods
of the best known commercial
steel would have worn one hundred and forty-two
ten thousandths of an inch in making the
same mileage. Small figures, but in the history
of steel they promised to mark an epoch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>The inventor&rsquo;s mind was improving but he
had not as yet succeeded in recalling the formula.
While hoping for his recovery, the boys
were preparing to make a more rigorous test
of this new steel. The company were manufacturing
a new type of seaplane. Every afternoon
the two boys, togged out in aviator&rsquo;s
garb, were learning to fly this new plane. It
was planned that, when the boys found themselves
to be perfect masters of this new vehicle
of the air, the six connecting-rods should be
placed in the motor of the seaplane, and that
it be shipped to the Pacific coast. There, under
ideal conditions, they were to test out, not
only the connecting-rods, but the seaplane, flying,
as a last trial, a thousand miles or more.</p>
<p>The pay Johnny had received for the cross-continent
trip had enabled him to make a large
payment on his debt of honor. As for Pant,
he, for the first time in his life, had a savings
account.</p>
<p>During their forenoons they were busy in
the factory. At times Johnny thought of the
vial of dark liquid that reposed on the shelf
in the laboratory, the one he had placed there
the night he made the analysis of the mysterious
steel. At one time while in the laboratory
he had glanced up to make sure it was
there. It was still in its place. He had been
tempted to tell the chemist about it but was
afraid of being laughed at.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;in time I
will learn to make a chemical analysis myself.
Then I&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question of the strange white fire puzzled
him at times. He wondered, too, how the
automobile of the contortionist had happened
to catch fire in the desert. But these were mere
vague wonderings which had no answer.</p>
<p>Though they were well occupied during the
day, the boys found time at night for working
upon a new, strange problem of which as yet,
their friend, Mr. McFarland, the president and
manager, knew nothing. It was this problem
that occupied their minds at the present moment.
It was a stirring moment. Many nights
they had spent working over a new type of engine,
one that had never been set in a motor
vehicle before. Now it was ready for the try-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Track clear?&rdquo; breathed Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All clear,&rdquo; Pant whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a series of sudden sharp explosions.
These increased rapidly until they
became a loud and insistent purr. Then, with
the force and speed of a frightened pig, the
little motor car shot forward.</p>
<p>The movement was too sudden for the boys.
Johnny was thrown backward upon the floor.
Pant, thrown in a wild whirl to the right, saw
the motor, a black streak, shoot down the dark
alley-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got speed,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The wild snorting of the motor awakened
echoes in every corner of the factory. This
was followed almost immediately by a deafening
crash.</p>
<p>Pant started quickly forward, then paused.
Johnny was now on his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she explode or hit the wall?&rdquo; Pant
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny rubbed his bruised head ruefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t believe she could make such
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a powerful engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys were now on the run. They
arrived at the scene of the disaster just ahead
of a tall man carrying a flashlight and a bunch
of keys.</p>
<p>This man&mdash;the watchman&mdash;flashed his
light upon the bent and twisted metal that lay
against the wall, then demanded sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny with a wry smile, &ldquo;is
a pile of scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get fresh,&rdquo; the watchman warned.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I said it is,&rdquo; said Johnny seriously.
&ldquo;If you want to know what it was, I&rsquo;ll tell
you; it was a dust-eating mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman&rsquo;s mouth flew open. &ldquo;A&mdash;A,&rdquo;
he sputtered incredulously. &ldquo;I told you before,
young fellow, don&rsquo;t get fresh.&rdquo; He moved
a hand toward Johnny menacingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you the truth,&rdquo; said Johnny
stoutly. &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said a dust-burning
mule. That&rsquo;s what she was. It
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit of good to explain to you;
you wouldn&rsquo;t understand, and besides, I don&rsquo;t
want to. That&rsquo;s our secret. We have permission
from Mr. McFarland to conduct experiments
here nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have no permission to endanger
men&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Johnny admitted; &ldquo;we were a
bit careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just turn the facts in to the boss and
you can fight it out with him,&rdquo; said the watchman
sourly as he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said Johnny sorrowfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complete loss. We&rsquo;ll have to begin all
over again. But from that little test I am convinced
that the engine has a wonderful future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This particular one had a brief but eventful
past, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; grinned Pant.</p>
<p>After one more look at the wreck, they turned
and went their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>That night before he fell asleep Johnny reviewed
in his mind the events that led up to
the happenings of that evening.</p>
<p>He, Johnny, had been standing on the steps
of the official entrance to the plant one afternoon,
when Mr. McFarland had said to him:
&ldquo;Johnny, please go down to the north gate and
request that old man to go away. He is stopping
the workers as they pass and trying to
engage them in conversation. He looks like he
is a propagandist for some radical organization
trying to make the men discontented. Get rid
of him if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had turned out to be not a radical
at all, but a friendly and harmless old man who
was seeking some one who could be interested
in a new type of engine which he had invented.
Such a fine spoken and polished old gentleman
had he proved to be that Johnny had been prevailed
upon to accompany him to his home to
see the engine.</p>
<p>He had found the home of the aged inventor
to be a fourth-floor back flat, being merely
two dark rooms upon an alley. Here, with his
wife, a pleasant-faced old lady, he lived and
labored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he had said, as he uncovered the
engine with the dramatic movement of one who
unveils a great work of art, &ldquo;this engine of
mine is different from all other internal-combustion
engines. It doesn&rsquo;t burn gasoline; it burns
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust!&rdquo; Johnny had exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust!&rdquo; the old man had smiled. &ldquo;Watch
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched a lever. There followed a succession
of rapid and sharp explosions. These
increased in number per second until they became
a prolonged purr, as the one in the
&ldquo;mule&rdquo; had done. The engine was now revolving
at full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; the old man had smiled. &ldquo;She
runs&mdash;on dust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On dust,&rdquo; Johnny had repeated in a daze.</p>
<p>The old man had touched the lever and the
engine had stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think it strange,&rdquo; the old man had
smiled, motioning Johnny to a chair and taking
one himself; &ldquo;but, after all, is it so strange?
The first internal-combustion engine, we have
it on good authority, did not burn gasoline but
a composition of gun powder and other substances.
The greatest grain elevator in the
world was destroyed by a dust explosion. Billions
of fine particles of carbon dust gathered
in the air space above the wheat. A spark
touched it off. A tremendous explosion followed.
There is unlimited power there. Why
not harness it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking,&rdquo; he pointed at the engine,
&ldquo;upon the motor power of the future. It ran,
as you saw a moment ago, on coal dust, a very
finely powdered coal dust. A little is let in at
a time. A slight ash is formed. This drops
out at the top of the cylinder, as you will see
the engine runs inverted. It was burning
coal dust, but any carbon dust will do. Wood
ground fine, wheat dust, peat dust, any carbon
dust will drive it. Think what that means to
the world-traveler of the future! No more
disgusting waiting for gasoline; no more weary
miles on foot. You land in the heart of Africa,
India, Siberia. You have with you a small
grinder like a wheat mill. It is run by batteries.
You are out of fuel. You merely grind
up a dry tree-trunk, a sack of wheat or a few
pounds of coal, and you are away again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a dream,&rdquo; Johnny had sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a dream&mdash;a dream that has come
true,&rdquo; the old man had fairly shouted. &ldquo;All that
is needed is capital to perfect larger motors,
to put them upon the market. If only your
president can be made to see it, as you and I
see it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Johnny had gripped the old inventor&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next night Pant had accompanied Johnny
to the aged inventor&rsquo;s room, and there over
some wonderful coffee and doughnuts prepared
by the inventor&rsquo;s wife, they talked over the future
of the strange dust-burning engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>It was decided that, since the engine had
never been tried out in any vehicle, Johnny and
Pant should obtain permission to experiment
with it in the factory after hours to perfect it
further before it was presented to the busy
president.</p>
<p>Three weeks of spare time experimenting had
resulted in the complete wreck of the engine,
smashed against a brick wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have to begin all over again, and
because that watchman turns us in we&rsquo;ll have
to show our plans to the president,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>The revealing of their plans was not the misfortune
they thought it, for Mr. McFarland at
once became keenly interested in the enterprise.
He took them off their regular work and set
them doing full time in experimenting with this
new engine.</p>
<p>In two weeks they had a new mule doing
double-quick time all over the shop. Another
two weeks saw them riding about the streets of
the city in a car driven by a dust-burning motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Their happiness knew no bounds. Boundless,
too, were their ambitions. This should
be the airplane engine of the future. Two
twelve-cylinder motors were manufactured for
the seaplane they were to drive and the plane
and motors were shipped to the Pacific coast
where, over the placid waters of a bay, they
might experiment with little danger of disaster.</p>
<p>They had been on the Pacific coast, driving
the plane equipped with the two dust-burning
motors and with one of the motors using the six
connecting-rods of mysterious steel, for a week
when one day Johnny decided to make a short
drive over the country alone. Not suspecting
that anyone could, this time, be on their trail,
he told Pant of his intention while in the lobby
of their hotel while a number of persons were
present.</p>
<p>He made a successful trip of some two hundred
miles. A fog had blown up from the sea
but he knew the location of a beautiful mountain
lake which he had often longed to visit.
On an island in this lake, he had been told, were
to be found traces of the wonderful fossilized
forests for which the West is famous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>By circling low he succeeded in locating the
placid surface of the lake and in making a creditable
landing. Unbuckling his harness he rose
stiffly, stretched his cramped limbs, then, turning
hastily, unlashed a small skiff from the back
of the fuselage and, having tossed it lightly
into the water, seized the paddle, leaped into
the skiff and paddled rapidly toward the shore.</p>
<p>He had been gone for perhaps five minutes
when, without warning, from out of the white
fog there appeared the prow of a small motorboat.
The engine was not going. The two
occupants of the boat were rowing, each with
one oar. Their destination, beyond doubt, was
the seaplane.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken until the taller of
the two men, a strange-appearing fellow with
unusually long fingers, put out a hand and,
steadying himself for a moment, leaped from
the boat to the lower wing of the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work fast,&rdquo; the shorter man cautioned in
a whisper. &ldquo;He may be back any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Count on me. Don&rsquo;t want any mix-up.
Nasty business,&rdquo; whispered the other, then with
a spring he was away down the length of the
plane. The next minute he had climbed to a
narrow platform parallel with the powerful
motors which hung suspended halfway between
the upper and lower planes.</p>
<p>Drawing a wrench and a pair of pliers from
his pocket, he worked over the engine to the
right for some eight or ten minutes. When he
had finished, he mumbled something that
sounded like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;ll slow him up,&rdquo; then thrusting
his tools, together with some other small objects,
into his pocket, he leaped back to the
plane, and, racing down its length, sprang into
the motorboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you had decided to stay,&rdquo; grumbled
the waiting man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough,&rdquo; the other drawled. Seizing
his oar, he pushed the boat away from the
plane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The next moment they disappeared silently
into the fog. They had been gone but an incredibly
short time when Johnny reappeared
in his shallow skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s still here,&rdquo; he breathed with a
sigh of satisfaction. &ldquo;Guess I ought not to
take such chances, but who&rsquo;d be out here that
knows our secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He climbed happily back to his seat in the
plane, buckled on his harness, then touched his
lever.</p>
<p>But what was this? The engine gave a few
sput-sputs, then stopped dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not believe his senses. He tried it
again. No better results.</p>
<p>Snatching off his harness, he leaped to the
platform beside the motor.</p>
<p>For a moment his eyes and his fingers played
over the line of spark plugs of the twelve-cylinder
motor, as a skilled musician plays over
the keys of an organ.</p>
<p>Then his face went blank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Changed!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s
been here. That spark plug there; never had
one like that. And that one; I cracked the
enamel when I put one in there. It&rsquo;s gone.
Perfectly good-looking one there now. Somebody&rsquo;s
tampered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from his pocket a wrench. Quickly
unscrewing the spark plug, he placed it on top
of the cylinder, then gave the propeller a whirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No spark,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Dead! Dead as
a last year&rsquo;s ragweed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he paused in thought.</p>
<p>The next moment he was all action. Dropping
to the fuselage, he dragged from within
the space back of the seat numerous odds
and ends of wooden rods, coils of wire, clamps,
bolts and glass insulators. These he pieced together
with incredible speed. At length a wire-strung
pole was thrust high in air. Wires
were attached at the bottom, a receiver thrust
over his head, and then, seated in his place before
the wheel, he was allowing his fingers to
play upon the key of a wireless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sput&mdash;sput&mdash;sput!&rdquo; The snap of the
electric current sounded above him. He was
sending out an S. O. S. addressed to Pant at
the home station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sput-sput-sput,&rdquo; the instrument sounded
again and again. Each time he waited for an
answer. At last, to his great joy, it came.
The buzzing in his receiver resolved itself into
the dots and dashes of the Morse code:
&ldquo;Shoot, Pant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the intruders was plain
enough. They had hoped to drive Johnny to
desert his plane in this lonely spot, then they
would return and strip it of its priceless steel
at their leisure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo; he hissed.</p>
<p>Again his fingers played on the key. He
instructed Pant to bring twelve spark plugs
to the island on Lake Poncetrane. He was to
make a landing there, if possible, then to bring
the spark plugs to the northeast corner of the
island where he, Johnny, would be waiting for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>He listened until the other boy&rsquo;s O. K. rang
in his ears then, removing the receiver from
his head, he settled back in his seat. It would
be two hours before Pant arrived. Everything
would be all right if&mdash;suddenly he sat up
straight, his brow wrinkled&mdash;&ldquo;if he can land
on the island!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;and I doubt if
he can. There&rsquo;s a small bare space in the very
center, and that is covered with rocks; the rest
is timbered. If he can&rsquo;t land, we lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he rose and, having drawn himself
up beside the motor, busied himself with the
task of removing the faulty spark plugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villains!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dirty
trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had just completed his task of removing
the spark plugs, when there came to his waiting
ear the drum of a powerful motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;good old Pant. He&rsquo;s
made it in record time. Now if only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish. He dared not hope that
it could be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>The thunder of the motor grew louder. The
fog had cleared now, and he could see the
plane, an airplane Pant had borrowed, like some
gigantic dragon fly, drifting down upon him.</p>
<p>Before it reached the spot in the sky above
him, it swerved to the right and went skimming
low over the tree-tops of the island.</p>
<p>Johnny made no move to go ashore; there
would be time enough for that after Pant had
effected a landing&mdash;if he did.</p>
<p>For a second or two the drum of the motor
ceased, and Johnny&rsquo;s heart stopped beating with
it. Could Pant make it?</p>
<p>But again came the thunder of the motor.
Again the plane appeared above the trees. He
had not found a safe landing place.</p>
<p>Once more the plane circled over the island,
then dipped out of sight. Again the motor
stopped. This time Johnny was sure Pant had
been successful, but again his hopes fell, for
the plane rose to circle once more.</p>
<p>Four times he attempted it; four times failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; Johnny sank
limply down into his seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>But Pant was swinging around. He was preparing
to pass low over the seaplane. What
could he want?</p>
<p>As he came scudding along with engine shut
off, Johnny heard him shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he saw his hand shoot out.
Something dropped from that hand. Straight
down it dropped for a hundred feet, then something
resembling a parachute filled with air
appeared, and checked its fall.</p>
<p>Quickly Johnny leaped into his skiff and
was away to the spot where this miniature
parachute would fall. The thing was heavy.
Could he reach it before it dragged the parachute
to the bottom of the lake? Straining
every muscle, he sent the skiff flying over the
surface of the water.</p>
<p>The parachute had fallen into the lake. Now
he was a hundred feet from it, now fifty, now
twenty-five, and now&mdash;now, his hand shot out
and seized it just as, water-logged, it was beginning
to sink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>As he dragged the cloth affair from the
water, from his lips there escaped a glad shout.
Attached to the parachute&rsquo;s cord were three
spark plugs.</p>
<p>Hardly had he made this discovery than there
came again the shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did watch, and did do his best, but in
spite of his efforts the second parachute sank
before he reached it.</p>
<p>But there were others. Twice more he succeeded
and three times failed. But he now had
nine new spark plugs. Surely there were enough.</p>
<p>Paddling hastily to the plane, he made the
changes, dropped into his seat, and again
touched his lever. This time there came a welcome
burst of thunder and he was away.</p>
<p>He gazed for a second behind him to see
Pant, his purpose fulfilled, speeding away toward
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; smiled Johnny, &ldquo;was a clever trick.
I&rsquo;d never have thought of it. But trust good
old Pant for that. Who&rsquo;d have thought,
though,&rdquo; his brow wrinkled, &ldquo;that old Slim
Jim, the contortionist, was still on our trail?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Strangely enough, during the days that followed
the contortionist put in no second appearance.</p>
<p>Three weeks of testing proved to them that
their engines were a complete success. Then
began what proved to be their great adventure.</p>
<p>There came to them a short, bald-headed man
of middle age, with a letter from Mr. McFarland,
their employer.</p>
<p>The letter read: &ldquo;This gentleman, Professor
Paul Lasky, is a very close friend of mine. He
may ask you to do something difficult and dangerous.
Do it if you can, for his cause is worthy
and his need imperative.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The stranger was not slow in laying his
needs before them. A tramp steamer had gone
on the shoals of a coral island some two thousand
miles from the Pacific coast of America.
Some passengers and members of the crew had
been drowned. The others had been rescued.
The wreck was driven high on the sand in a
sheltered bay, so she would not break up at
once. Some hardy adventurers, claiming to
have owned the steamer, had put off in another
steamer four days previous with the purpose
of salvaging her cargo. It was imperative that
he, the professor, should reach the wreck before
them. A seaplane was the only craft that
could bring him to the island in time, and of all
the air-craft then on the coast, none had the
possibilities of such protracted flight save their
own. He wished them to take him there. The
reward would be ample and, should his mission
be successfully accomplished, they would be real
benefactors of mankind, since some tens of
thousands of children would be benefited.</p>
<p>Johnny and Pant held a long consultation.
The undertaking was a serious one. Could it
be that the stranger knew the type of engine
their plane carried? His mission must indeed
be an important one if a mere landsman, accustomed
to neither the sea nor the air, would attempt
such a perilous flight to accomplish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; Johnny demanded of
Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell. Some treasure on the ship,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the ship and the cargo belong to the
men who have gone to strip the wreck, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not. Perhaps,
at least, not all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you are ready to undertake it,
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant, gripping
Johnny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It will be a wonderful test
for our motors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think our contortionist friend
can follow us,&rdquo; smiled Johnny.</p>
<p>Twenty hours later, after having covered fifteen
hundred miles in steady flight, they realized
that it was indeed to be a wonderful test
for their motors, and to them as well; a test out
of which they might never emerge.</p>
<p>They were sailing high over a boundless expanse
of water, when Johnny suggested that
they drop to the level of the sea and rest their
motors for an hour as they drifted, sea-gull-like,
on the surface of the gently heaving ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly calm down there,&rdquo; he called
through his speaking-tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so.&rdquo; Pant, who was acting as pilot,
set her nose downward and slowed his engine
for volplaning.</p>
<p>As they neared the surface of the water, an
exclamation of surprise escaped Pant&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s rolling in great billows. Not a
breath of air, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s stifling,&rdquo; grumbled Johnny.</p>
<p>Pant gave one look at the barometer. Instantly
his face clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know the glass could drop so low,&rdquo;
he mumbled. &ldquo;Nasty weather coming. Can&rsquo;t
float on that water. Better climb back up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the plane climbed skyward again.
When she had reached a high altitude, with the
suddenness of thought she ceased to climb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>It was as if she had run, head on, into an
immense filmy veil of silk that hung from the
high heavens, its fringe touching the sea. The
veil was dark, the darkness of midnight blue.
It seized the plane and set it twirling, whirling,
pitching, plunging. It was as if a giant
hand had seized the veil from above and twisted
it, as one twists a damp towel to wring it.</p>
<p>It was then that Pant at the wheel lost all
control. Johnny, in the cabin, became an over-large
punching-bag. Harnessed to his seat
from every side, he swung now into space, and
now jammed hard into place, to feel himself
banged against the side of the narrow cabin.
With head sunk limply forward, with his whole
body relaxed, he waited dumbly for the end.
What that end might be, he could not even
guess. They were caught in a typhoon, hundreds
of miles from land, somewhere in mid-Pacific.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />A PLANE IN A TYPHOON</h2>
<p>When they struck the typhoon Johnny had
the courage to hope that Pant might bring
them out of it in safety. This, however, seemed
scarcely believable. The cabin, a moment before
stuffy as a clothes closet, was now as
breezy as a mosquito-bar tent in a stiff wind.
She was battened tight, too. The mad whirl
of the plane made Johnny dizzy and sick. His
ears were full of strange sounds. The creak
and groan of planes, stays and guys, that
seemed about to snap, was mingled with the
thunder of the engines. Above all this, like the
voice of some mad siren&rsquo;s spirit filled with
hatred and revenge, rang out the shrill scream
of the wind. Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were blinded by
strange weird lights&mdash;red, yellow and purple&mdash;flash
upon flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be in the midst of the gigantic
smithy where lightning bolts are forged,&rdquo; he
grumbled, as he closed his eyes tight and took
one more mad whirl that it seemed must be the
craft&rsquo;s last.</p>
<p>But at that, the seemingly last moment, the
whirling gale took a strange turn. The plane
hung motionless in mid-air. By good fortune
she stood right side up. Her planes were as
yet unimpaired.</p>
<p>She was a staunch craft. Not a stick, nor
wire, nor screw but had been tested and doubly
inspected before they went into her. Her two
twelve-cylinder engines, lying one beside the
other above the fuselage, were bound and braced
from every side. Johnny thought of all this as
they lay there suspended in space.</p>
<p>It was a lull; he understood that well enough.
A strange lull it was, too, as if the storm had
taken their frail craft into its gigantic fist, as
an ape holds a fledgling bird in his horny claw
before crashing it against the trunk of a tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s lips were pressed to the speaking-tube.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it!&rdquo; he shrilled to his pal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; came back from Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you standing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant retorted with a grim chuckle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad. Pretty wet out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to climb. Top to this thing somewhere,
maybe. Nobody knows, though. It&rsquo;s a
typhoon. Always wanted to see what a plane&rsquo;d
do in a typhoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, but never tell, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out&mdash;here she comes again! It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s voice seemed blown
back into him by the terrific gust of wind. The
next instant, a darkness such as he had never
seen; a tumult such as he had never heard; a
torrent of rain such as he had never witnessed;
a wild whirling such as he had never experienced,
drove all power of thought from his befuddled
brain, leaving him again a half-animate,
over-large punching-bag, swinging in the
narrow center of the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Even in this dizzy state of half-consciousness
he thought of Pant. When told that he
might not escape disaster, he had not said, &ldquo;I
have escaped before.&rdquo; He might have said it,
for there had been other adventures; a night
in a forest in India, with a mad black leopard&rsquo;s
eyes gleaming at him out of the darkness; an
hour in a dungeon-dark cave, with murderous
savages about him. There had been other adventures,
too, and he had escaped; yet he did
not say, &ldquo;I will again.&rdquo; That was the kind
of fellow he was. Confident of his ability, interested
in all of life, thrilled by each new experience,
he stood ready to face each one as it
came and do battle valiantly, leaving the results
to a power greater, a mind wiser, than his own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>At this moment when Johnny was thinking
these thoughts, Pant was being dragged forward
half out of his soggy, water-soaked harness,
then slammed back into his seat, to be deluged
to the drowning by a downpour that was
not rain, he thought, but more like a sky-suspended
tank of fresh water. He found himself
surprised that the plane held up against it; that
it did not sink at once into the sea. His leather
coat hung like a weight of steel upon his
shoulders; his eyes, his ears, his mouth were
filled with water. It chilled, benumbed, depressed
him.</p>
<p>The plane was traveling with the gale;
whether in a circle or straight ahead, he could
not tell. The engine was shut off. Would it
start again at his bidding? That he did not
know. If not, their situation was hopeless. The
time would come when the storm would drop
them, as it drops a bird it has harried and beaten
to its death. Then, with no power, they would
sink helpless into the sea. And such a sea as
it must be! He had not seen it since the storm
began. He could imagine it, though. Black,
angry water tossed into foam. Billows, mountain
high. What a landing-place for a seaplane!
One resounding crash that echoed above
the demon laughter of the waves, then all would
be over!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She must start! She must,&rdquo; he muttered.
Half-unconsciously he put his hand to the lever,
then quickly drew it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now, not now,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The
dust! The dust! If only it is still dry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, for a moment, his mind dwelt upon
the wind. It was strange about that wind. It
did not come in gusts, but flowed straight on
like a stream of water. In the utter darkness,
flooded by torrents of rain, carried steadily forward
by that constant flow of wind, he was
overcome by an illusion. He fancied himself
passing beneath the surface of the sea. Only
the touching of his tongue to his lips, to satisfy
his mind that this was not salt water that beat
in from every side, could dispel the illusion.</p>
<p>The whole thing was so terrific, so altogether
beyond comprehension, that it shunted off the
powers that drove his brain to action. It was
altogether unbelievable.</p>
<p>As Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s mind cleared itself of
the effects of the airship&rsquo;s mad whirl, it began
puzzling over certain questions: What was to
be the end of this? Why where they there?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The truth was, Johnny did not know why
they were there. They had come upon this long
and perilous air journey over the sea at the
request of a stranger. No, perhaps they had
not been as mad as that. The man had brought
with him a letter of introduction from their
employer. Yet, why should he not have told
them more of his intentions? How could this
journey benefit tens of thousands of children?
They were in imminent danger of being destroyed
by the storm. He felt that it would
help if only he knew the reason why.</p>
<p>There came another whirl. He caught his
breath and tried to think clearly. It was a
monstrous experience; he could not think of it
in any other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t last long&mdash;wonder we haven&rsquo;t hit
the water before this. Must have been mighty
high up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his surprise and great relief, the plane
again righted herself. This time, half on her
side, she lay upon the air like a crippled bird
poising for its death plunge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>His lips were at the tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do?&rdquo; he shouted above
the roar of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going&mdash;to&mdash;get&mdash;out&mdash;of&mdash;here,&rdquo; came
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&mdash;try. Look&mdash;out. Start&mdash;engine.
May&mdash;take&mdash;tailspin. Can&rsquo;t&mdash;be&mdash;worse,&mdash;though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant there came the thunder of
the powerful motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! Dust&rsquo;s dry,&rdquo; Pant muttered
as he tried to straighten up his tilted car.</p>
<p>When he heard the thunder of the motors,
Pant could scarcely have been more thankful
about anything. True, there were not another
such pair of engines in the world, but there
had been a strain put upon every bolt, rod,
feed-pipe and screw such as had been endured
by no other engines. If there had been a single
break, then all was lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>When they did respond to his touch, he at
once tilted his right plane in such a manner as
to square her up. The wind was blowing steadily,
and, he thought, less violently, though this
was hard to concede, since it seemed to him
that a more madly violent gale than even now
was blowing would be hard to imagine.</p>
<p>The plane righted herself gracefully. Truly,
this was a marvelous bit of machinery, made
by master builders. She had been designed for
dependability rather than speed, yet she presented
a rather rakish appearance, her upper
planes jutting out over the lower ones by a full
five feet. Her fuselage was built like the body
of a wasp, in two parts. In the forward part
was the driver&rsquo;s seat, fully exposed to the open
air. In the rear portion was a closed cabin
fitted with two seats. These seats in fair
weather might be made to collapse in such a
manner as to form a bed. Thus it was possible
for one aviator to rest while the other was at the
wheel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>But the distinctive part of the whole equipment
was the engines. If Pant had felt any
misgivings about the type of engine their plane
was fitted with, the next few minutes made him
doubly thankful that they were just what they
were.</p>
<p>Hardly had they begun a mad rush straight
away with the wind, the nose of the plane
tilted twenty-five degrees upward, than there
began to play about him vivid sparks of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picking up lightning,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Like lights twinkling on the deck of a steamer
the sparks leaped from plane to plane. They
flashed down the guy-wires and braces, leaped
to the motors. Setting her firing irregularly
for a second, they raced for the tail, only to
flash back to the wheel and give Pant&rsquo;s arm
such a sudden twist that for the second he was
paralyzed.</p>
<p>The next moment his lips were at the tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty bad,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Dangerous&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&mdash;stop&mdash;her,&rdquo; came back from
Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s hand was at the lever. The engine
went still, but just at that instant a tremendous
flash leaped up from the large tank at the rear
of the fuselage.</p>
<p>Pant leaped high, then sank back with a
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Man!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;If that had
been gasoline in that tank! If it had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brow wrinkled. &ldquo;I only hope it didn&rsquo;t
rip her wide open. Anyway, we climbed some.
Can afford to glide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were surrounded by a succession of
vivid flashes of lightning. The plane was
tipped to a rakish angle. Through a storm-washed
window Johnny saw what lay below.
The ocean, vast, mysterious, dark and terrible,
appeared as a limitless open-hearth steel furnace
filled with gleaming molten metal.</p>
<p>In the very midst of this was what appeared
at first to be a mere splotch on the surface, but
which in time resolved itself into the form of
a steamship.</p>
<p>He gasped as he made out its form, &ldquo;To
think,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that any ship could live
in this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Yet, as he thought of it, he knew that they
had in years past. He had read authentic accounts
of ships riding out such a storm.</p>
<p>Even as he watched he saw the water smooth
out into what he knew to be the surface of a
gigantic wave; saw, amid the flashes, the ship
leap forward to meet it; saw her prow rest on
air; saw her plunge; saw her buried beneath an
avalanche of sea.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes, expecting never again to
see that ship; yet, when he opened them, she
was still there battling with the elements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; he exclaimed involuntarily.</p>
<p>The next instant the plane tipped back into
position, the engines roared, he felt her turn
and knew that Pant had set her head-on against
the storm.</p>
<p>He listened to the roar of the engines and
thrilled at the battle as he felt the shock of the
storm.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as the sheet-lightning flashed, he
saw a dark object pass his window, then another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The parachutes!&rdquo; he exclaimed in consternation.
He put his lips to the tube: &ldquo;Storm&mdash;tore&mdash;the&mdash;parachutes&mdash;away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;know,&rdquo; came back from Pant. &ldquo;No&mdash;good&mdash;now,&mdash;anyway.
Can&rsquo;t&mdash;land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then at the very thought, Johnny laughed.
On a calm sea the parachutes might save them;
in such a storm, never.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw&mdash;a&mdash;ship&mdash;down&mdash;there. See&mdash;her?&rdquo;
he asked a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;the&mdash;ship&mdash;we&rsquo;re&mdash;racing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might&mdash;be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;it&mdash;is&mdash;we&mdash;win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;we&mdash;live&mdash;through,&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence. But again there came a
sound from the tube. This time it was not
Pant, but the stranger who rode behind Johnny.
Johnny started; he had quite forgotten him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought&mdash;I&mdash;ought&mdash;to&mdash;tell&mdash;you.&rdquo;
The voice was low and subdued, like a parson
reading the funeral service at a grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell&mdash;me&mdash;what?&rdquo; Johnny asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About&mdash;the&mdash;wreck. Why&mdash;we&mdash;are&mdash;going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at that instant there came a blinding
flash, a deafening roar, and the plane seemed
to leap into midair, like a rowboat hit by a
fifty-pound projectile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />THE TASTE OF SALT SEA WATER</h2>
<p>When he had collected his scattered senses
after the tremendous lift which the plane had
been subjected to, Johnny Thompson knew that
they must have been in the midst of a terrific
electrical explosion which had occurred in mid-air;
a current of electricity such as no mere
man-made voltmeter would ever measure had
leaped from cloud to cloud. For a fraction of
a second the circuit had been broken. The explosion
had followed.</p>
<p>Pressing his lips to Pant&rsquo;s tube, Johnny inquired
curiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any&mdash;damage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;tell&mdash;yet,&rdquo; came back. &ldquo;Hope&mdash;not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was no sound, save the
screaming of the wind. Then, again, came the
call of the stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About&mdash;the&mdash;wreck. Ought&mdash;to&mdash;tell.
May&mdash;not&mdash;come&mdash;out&mdash;of&mdash;this. You&mdash;may&mdash;come&mdash;out.
Can&mdash;you&mdash;hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;yes!&rdquo; Johnny was impatient of
delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought&mdash;to&mdash;tell. Mighty&mdash;important.
Wreck&mdash;mighty&mdash;important. Lot&mdash;of&mdash;people&mdash;affected.
Children&mdash;most. Ought&mdash;to&mdash;tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why doesn&rsquo;t he tell?&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s
mental comment. &ldquo;Has the storm driven him
mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to know about that wreck. His
life was imperiled for a cause, but what cause
he did not know. His mission in life, he had
found out long ago, was to help others live
more happily and profitably. If the cause were
a good enough cause, he might cheerfully die
for it. &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; the man had said, &ldquo;many
children.&rdquo; Well, that was best of all: to help
many children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny grumbled through the tube,
&ldquo;why&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going&mdash;to&mdash;tell,&rdquo; came to Johnny through
the tube. Then the Professor told his story.
There was a pause between every pair of words;
the wail of the storm, the thunder of the engines,
the roar of the ocean, made it necessary.
Even so, he was forced to repeat several sentences
over and over before Johnny caught
them. It was aggravating, doubly so since
any word might be the man&rsquo;s last; might be
the last Johnny ever listened to, as well. There
was one word the man repeated ten times or
more, and, at that, Johnny did not catch it.
It was an important word, too, the most important
word, the very keyword, but Johnny
gave it up at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t any use,&rdquo; he muttered after the tenth
time. &ldquo;Some great treasure, but whether it&rsquo;s
gold or diamonds, or old ivory or frankincense,
I&rsquo;ll never be able to tell, if I ask him a thousand
times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The stranger, it seemed, was a professor in
a medical college; his brother, a medical missionary
in one of those border countries that lie
between China and Russia. During the war
something became very scarce, but just what
something Johnny could not make out. He, the
Professor, wrote his brother about it. The
something came from Russia&mdash;only place it
could be obtained. There was fighting still in
those regions where it was found, between the
bolsheviki and their enemies. Children in the
United States, it seemed, tens of thousands of
them, would benefit if it were brought out from
Russia. Johnny could not see how that could
be. &ldquo;Perhaps the mine belongs to an orphanage,&rdquo;
he decided, half in humor, half in earnest.</p>
<p>The Professor had written his missionary
brother of the need. He had written that he
thought that, for the sake of the children, the
thing must be managed. It could be carried
out, the treasure could. It would require a considerable
investment, perhaps twenty thousand
dollars. The Professor had sold his home, had
raked and scraped, borrowed and begged. At
last the money was sent to the brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Months of anxious waiting followed. Finally
there came a cable from an obscure Chinese
port. The missionary brother had the precious
stuff and was boarding the &ldquo;Men-Cheng,&rdquo; a
tramp steamer, manned half by Chinamen and
half by white men. She bore a Chinese name
but carried an American flag.</p>
<p>He had not trusted the officers and steward
of her overmuch, so, instead of putting his
treasure in their hands, he had chartered a two-berth
stateroom and had carried it with him in
four flat chests. Piling three of them on the
lower berth, and sliding the other beneath, he
had slept in the berth above.</p>
<p>That cable was the last ever heard from him.
The steamer had been caught in a gale and
driven upon the shore of a coral island, as
Johnny already knew. The missionary brother
did not appear with the rescued members of
passengers and crew. All these survivors had
been questioned, but none knew anything about
what became of him. It seemed probable that
he had come on deck in the storm and had been
washed overboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>And the treasure was there still. Beyond
question, it was in that stateroom where he had
stored it, since none but him knew of it.</p>
<p>The wrecking crew, more than likely, was a
gang of ghouls, with no principle, and with no
knowledge of such things, anyway. They
would either dump the treasure into the sea
or carry it away. In either case it would be a
total loss, and the small fortune of the Professor
would be gone forever. It seemed, however,
that the Professor was more concerned about
the children&rsquo;s share than he was about his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of treasure could it be,&rdquo; Johnny
asked himself, &ldquo;that even the roughest, most
ignorant rascals would dump into the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunch of nonsense,&rdquo; he muttered. Yet
there was something about the intense earnestness
of the man that gripped him, convinced
him that it was not nonsense, but that here was
a truly great and worthy cause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Suddenly it came to him that, were he to outlive
the stranger and reach the wreck, he would
have no means of identifying the chests. Again
his lips were at the tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;chests!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;the&mdash;chests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;chests. How&mdash;can&mdash;you&mdash;identify&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sentence was broken halfway. There
came such a thundering, grinding, screaming
horror of noises as he had never heard, not
even in this hurricane. The seaplane stood
still. Her engines were going, but she did not
move. It was as if the shaft had broken loose
from the propeller and was running wild, yet
Johnny knew this was not so. He knew that
the violence of the storm had suddenly become
so great that the plane could make no headway
before it.</p>
<p>So there they stood, halted in mid-air. What
must come next? Was this the end? These
questions burned their way to the very depths
of his throbbing brain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>He had not long to wait for action. The
plane began to turn slowly about. It was as
if it were set upon a perpendicular shaft, and
a mighty hand was gripping and turning it
against its motor&rsquo;s power to resist.</p>
<p>Then the thunder of the engines ceased;
Pant had foreseen the ultimate end of the
struggle and had prepared himself for it.</p>
<p>The plane swung around, square with the
wind, then began a glide which increased in
speed with each fraction of a second. Pant
was dragged from his seat by the mere force
of the air. With nostrils flattened, eyes closed,
body bent like a western rider&rsquo;s, as he is thrown
in the air by a bucking bronco, he still clung
to the wheel and guided the craft as best he
could.</p>
<p>Feeling himself constantly drawn to the
right, he realized that they were not gliding
straight downward, but were following a gigantic
spiral&mdash;perhaps miles across. He shuddered.
He had experienced something similar
to this in his boyhood days&mdash;the spiral glide
of the amusement park. Yet that was child&rsquo;s
play. This was grim reality, and at the end
of the glide lay the remorseless, plunging sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson and the Professor sat in
their cabin, too much overcome to move or
speak. Through Johnny&rsquo;s mind there ran
many wild thoughts. Now the past, his home,
his friends, his mother, were mirrored before
his mind&rsquo;s vision. The next he was contemplating
freeing himself from his harness and
opening the cabin door. To be trapped in that
cabin, strapped to his seat, as they took the
plunge into the sea, would be terrible. Better
that he might have one fierce battle with the
ocean. Yet there was still a chance&mdash;a ghost
of a chance&mdash;some startling development that
might save them. Then, if he were loose in
the cabin, the cabin door open, he would be
shaken out to his death while the plane flew
on to safety.</p>
<p>He ended by doing nothing at all, and the
plane, holding true to her spiral glide, swung
on toward the dark waters. The spiral seemed
endless. One might almost have imagined that
the storm had an upward twist and was shooting
them toward the skies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s flash of lightning undeceived
them. The sea lay close beneath them, perilously
close; almost it appeared to be lifting
up hands to grasp them.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson at last began to struggle
with his harness. Pant licked his lips
with his tongue and thereby received a revelation.
The moisture on his lips was salt; they
were in the midst of the salt spray of some
titanic wave. The end was not far off.</p>
<p>In desperation he kicked the engines into
gear. There followed a moment of suspense.
Thinking of it afterward, not one of the three
could account for what followed. Perhaps
the current of air created by some on-rushing
wave had lifted them; perhaps the very force
of the powerful engines had torn them from
the grip of the remorseless spiral glide. Whatever
it was, they suddenly found themselves
booming along over the raging sea, and with
each hundred yards covered there came a lessening
of the wind&rsquo;s violence. It seemed that
they were truly on their way to safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Johnny started as from a revery. The signal
from the Professor&rsquo;s speaking-tube was
screaming insistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those&mdash;chests,&rdquo; came back through the
tube. &ldquo;Do&mdash;you&mdash;hear&mdash;me? Those&mdash;chests&mdash;they&mdash;are&mdash;marked&mdash;with&mdash;initials&mdash;L&mdash;B&mdash;on
the bottom. Do&mdash;you&mdash;hear?
L&mdash;like&mdash;lake. B&mdash;like&mdash;bird. Get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, save for the thunder of the engines
and the diminishing howl of the wind, there
was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I had tried harder to get the name
of those things in the four chests,&rdquo; Johnny
mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like mighty well to know. Didn&rsquo;t
sound like anything I have ever heard of. Perhaps
it&rsquo;s some kind of Russian fur; new name
for Russian sable, maybe. Guess there&rsquo;s no
use asking him about it now. Too much noise;
couldn&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Then his mind turned to the steamer they
had seen struggling in that raging sea. He
wondered if it had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;even if they
are our rivals. We&rsquo;ll beat them easily if we
get out of this. Looks like we would, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, his face went gray. He had
thought of something&mdash;the dust in the fuel
tank! There would have been enough to carry
them to their destination, and a little to spare,
had they not encountered the storm. They had
battled the storm for what seemed hours. This
had consumed much fuel. What awaited them
once they were free from this storm?</p>
<p>He put his mouth to Pant&rsquo;s speaking-tube,
but the message remained unspoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use to cross a bridge till we come to it,&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;Not out of the storm yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />LIFE&rsquo;S HAZARD OF A SINGLE GLIDE</h2>
<p>The coming out of the storm was like riding
out of night into the bright light of a new
day. Pant, as he sat at the wheel, steering as
in a dream, was entranced by the beauty and
wonder of it. They had been near death a
score of times in a single hour; now they were
racing away to life. Life! What a wonderful
privilege just to live! How foolish boys
must be who risk life for some useless plaything&mdash;to
accept a &ldquo;dare&rdquo; or experience
some new thrill. So he mused, and then all
at once he realized that they had risked their
lives for a cause of which they knew little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, as he settled himself more
firmly in his position behind the wheel, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
come this far, so we&rsquo;ve got to see it through.
I wonder how far that storm has carried us
off our course, and in what direction we are
going now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Rubbing the moisture off the glass of his
compass, he read their direction. Then he
started. They were going north by east, and
their course was set for south by southwest.</p>
<p>Pant stared at the compass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;At that rate, we&rsquo;ll
be back where we started from in due course
of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a new thought worried him. He, too,
had remembered the dust in the fuel tank. It
must be running low. He could not tell their
exact position, but believed they were far
nearer to a small group of islands which they
had sighted shortly before the storm struck
them than they were to their destination.</p>
<p>Immediately there was set up in his mind a
tense conflict. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to keep going in
your present direction and to seek safety with
a fresh supply of fuel from those islands you
just passed,&rdquo; said his native caution. &ldquo;You
have no right to turn back, for if you do you
are sure to lose the race,&rdquo; said his instinctive
loyalty to the cause of another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Loyalty won the day, and with mouth grimly
set he gradually turned the plane about. Skirting
the fringe of the storm, he sent the plane
speeding on her way.</p>
<p>Gradually the smoke of battle&mdash;the mists
that lay low on the horizon&mdash;disappeared, and
they emerged into the glorious sunlight. The
ocean lay a glittering mass of jewels beneath
them, jewels that sparkled on a robe of emerald
green. The sky, a vast blue dome, lay
spread above them, while a few white clouds
skirted the horizon. Behind them, like the uplifted
head of a terrible sea-dragon, the storm
still reared its masses of tumult to the heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Pant through his mouthpiece,
&ldquo;was the worst I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson threw back his head and
laughed. A merry laugh it was. It was easy
to laugh when they were free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>For an hour the plane held steadily on its
course&mdash;south by southwest. It was a wonderful
journey. Weary as he was and prone
to fall asleep at his post, Pant enjoyed it. Here
and there they passed flocks of sea-gulls that
rose screaming from the sea. Once they raced
for a few miles with a honking wedge of wild
geese. The presence of this flock made Pant
think they must be near some land. What
land it might be he could not even guess, but
the thought cheered him.</p>
<p>For an hour, an hour and a quarter, an hour
and a half, they sped on. Both boys had forgotten
the question of fuel. Johnny was
puzzling over the name of the contents of the
chests on the wreck; Pant was wondering about
the fate of the ship they had sighted in the
storm, when there came a hoarse rumble from
the right-hand engine, and the thunder of their
drivers was lessened by half.</p>
<p>With trembling hand Pant threw the lever
out. The other motor was still going, but he
realized that it would be but a matter of moments
until that one also was dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Instinctively, as if preparing to run away
from the ocean, which, having been lashed by
the storm, must still be rolling in great, sweeping
waves that would wreck their frail craft
the instant she touched its surface, he tilted
the plane&rsquo;s nose to a sharp angle and set her
climbing.</p>
<p>They had been traveling some three thousand
feet above the sea. Now they climbed
rapidly. Four thousand, and five thousand, six,
seven, eight, nine thousand. They were now
entering a filmy cloud that sent long waving
arms down to clutch them. Now and again
they &ldquo;bumped,&rdquo; dropping straight down a hundred
feet, then rising again. It was a glorious
experience, even if it might be their last.</p>
<p>With ears alert, as are the ears of a man
expecting the sentence of death, Pant awaited
the last hoarse cough of the engine.</p>
<p>Finally it came; a grinding whirr, a tremor
running through the plane, as a shudder runs
through the form of a dying animal, then all
was silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>It was such a silence as none of the three had
ever experienced. For hours they had listened
to the scream of the storm, to the roar of breakers,
to the thunder of their engines. For another
hour and a half they had listened to the
engines alone. Now there was utter silence; a
silence so intense that, had a feather been falling
from a sea-gull&rsquo;s wing, it seemed that its
passage through the air might be heard.</p>
<p>The plane had broad, spreading wings. It
would float with easy grace to the very surface
of the sea. But then?</p>
<p>There was plenty of time to think now. No
one cared to speak. Their minds were concerned
about many things. Life as they had
lived it lay spread out before them like the
pages of a picture-book. All the past moved
before them. They came to the end, at last,
and thus to the question of the ship in the
storm and the wreck on the desert island. Had
the ship escaped from the storm? Was the
wreck still intact, or had it been destroyed by
the waves? Would the wreckers find the
treasure? What then?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Slowly the plane drifted down. Eight thousand
feet, seven thousand, six, five, four, three.</p>
<p>Suddenly Pant moved in his seat. Seizing
his tube in his excitement, forgetting that they
might easily speak to one another since the
sound of the engines was gone, he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny threw open the door of the cabin
and sat listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hear the waves,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two kinds of sounds, though,&rdquo; smiled Pant;
&ldquo;a steady wash and a thundering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thundering means land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Johnny gazed down toward the
wide circle of the sea. &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. From this point in the air,
though they could see for many miles, only the
unbroken expanse of dark green waters met
their view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant in triumph. He
was pointing to a long line of white. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
surf. Some coral island there. Surf&rsquo;s breaking
over it. If we can make the lee of it we&rsquo;re
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>He brought the nose of the plane about until
it pointed toward the white line. Silence followed&mdash;a
silence that could almost be felt.
Only the murmur of vast waters and the distant
thunder of the breakers, like the falls of
a great river, disturbed that silence. Their
lives depended on the length of a single glide.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson opened two small round
windows, portholes to the cabin. The Professor,
sensing the tenseness of the situation, without
fully understanding it, did likewise. Then
the three of them watched the rolling ocean as
it rose up to meet them.</p>
<p>Now they appeared to be a mile from that
white line of foam. They were twenty-eight
hundred feet in air. At fifteen hundred feet
they appeared to be scarcely half a mile away.
Beneath them rolled the treacherous waves;
before them the breakers roared. Just over that
crest of foam there lay a narrow bay, still
as a millpond. Could they make it? Pant
lifted a trembling hand to his forehead to brush
away cold perspiration. Johnny stirred uneasily.
Only the Professor was silent. Motionless as
a sphinx, he watched the ocean spin along
beneath him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Gradually as they sank lower and lower objects
became distinct to them. The north end
of the island appeared to rise some twenty feet
above the sea. The south end was lower. The
whole of it was lined with a fringe of palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better turn her a bit south,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lower there and less chance of a
smash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Pant followed his directions.</p>
<p>Lower and lower they drifted. Closer and
closer came the island. For a time it seemed
that they must inevitably drop into the sea.
Then it appeared that they would miss the ocean
but drive into the palms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>A hundred feet in air they swept on. Catching
his breath, Pant unbuckled his harness.
Johnny and the Professor followed his example.
The next second, with a strange, land-like
breath of air sweeping up to them, they passed
over the very fringe-tops of the palms. One
moment later they were standing up in their
craft, which gently rose and fell with the water.
Without a word they solemnly shook hands.</p>
<p>There are moments in the life of every person
when he feels himself so closely welded to the
life of some other one that only death can separate
them. Johnny felt that such a time had
arrived in his life. He and Pant were already
inseparable. Now, by this simple, silent handshake,
they took the Professor into their narrow
circle. They had suffered in peril together.</p>
<p>They were now on a narrow island of the Pacific
in a seaplane without fuel, and with provisions
for but a day. Come what might, they
would stick together until the end.</p>
<p>Their first precaution was to bring their plane
as close in shore as the shallow water would permit,
then to anchor it securely. After that they
unfolded a small, collapsible boat and prepared
to make their way ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhabited or not?&rdquo; smiled Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If inhabited, cannibal or otherwise?&rdquo;
Johnny smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we are not to tarry here long,&rdquo; said
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tarry until we discover some fuel, and
I don&rsquo;t think green palm trees will be of much
use,&rdquo; said Johnny seriously. &ldquo;Have you anything
to suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor seemed inclined to take these
remarks as being in the form of a joke, but seeing
that Johnny was serious, he said, as his
brow wrinkled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really very important that we be on
our way. We cannot be more than a hundred
miles from our destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not even that,&rdquo; said Pant, &ldquo;but
they may be very hard miles to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only were there,&rdquo; sighed Johnny.
&ldquo;There is sure to be coal on the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, since we&rsquo;re not, let&rsquo;s explore our
island,&rdquo; suggested Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sleep,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to fall
asleep as I walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better bring the rifles,&rdquo; suggested Pant.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that there is a single living
soul on this island&mdash;it&rsquo;s no more than a
coral rock sticking up out of the sea; can&rsquo;t be
two miles long&mdash;but you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny brought two rifles from the plane.
After rubbing the moisture from their barrels,
he slipped a handful of cartridges in each, and
set them up in the bow of the boat.</p>
<p>Pant had already gathered up an armful of
sacks and cans, enough food for a day ashore.
Throwing these into the bottom of the boat, he
exclaimed: &ldquo;All aboard for no man&rsquo;s land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all climbed in. Johnny took the oars.
Ten minutes of rowing brought them ashore.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation that came to them
as they stepped on solid ground once more.
They had been swinging and tossing about for
so long that solid earth seemed unreal&mdash;only
part of a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see a sign of life,&rdquo; said Johnny as he
glanced up and down the beach, then into the
depths of the palms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit of bamboo that looks as if it
had been cut with a knife,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have drifted in,&rdquo; suggested Johnny.
Other than this they found no sign of life.</p>
<p>After a brief consultation they decided that,
simply as a matter of precaution, they should
make the rounds of the shore before settling
down to sleep.</p>
<p>Night would be coming on in an hour, so,
after partaking of a hasty repast, the two boys,
armed with the rifles, struck up the beach to
the right. The Professor was left to keep an
eye on the plane.</p>
<p>Nothing eventful happened until the boys had
made three-fourths of their journey. As they
had expected, they had found no sign of human
life on the island. Night was falling; the sea
was growing calm after the storm; they were
looking forward to a few hours of refreshing
sleep when, of a sudden, as they rounded a
clump of palms, Johnny sprang backward, and,
clutching his companion&rsquo;s arm, dragged him
into the deeper shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; stammered Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camp fire on the beach, and men, six or
eight of them, I think, sitting about it. Natives,
I should judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the boys stood there in silence. It
was a tense moment. Each in his own way
was trying to solve the problem that had suddenly
thrust itself upon them. Should they
show themselves to the natives, or should they
try to discover some way to escape from the
islands?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Pant, as if talking to
himself, &ldquo;that we can get off the island without
their aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ship might appear,&rdquo; suggested Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re too far off
the beaten path of sea travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. C&rsquo;m&rsquo;on,&rdquo; said Johnny, as he led
the way out into the open where the camp fire
gleamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />FLYING KNIVES</h2>
<p>The two boys approached the strangers with
rifles loosely slung under their arms, as if they
had just come from hunting. The men about
the fire showed no signs of surprise. They did
not leap to their feet nor attempt to glide away.
They merely turned their heads at the sound of
footsteps, then sat there watching as the boys
approached.</p>
<p>Pant took the lead. He had lived among men
of many climes, and would doubtless be better
able to understand these strangers. Reaching
the edge of the circle he sat down by the fire,
motioning Johnny to do the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>For several moments the little group sat in
silence. Out of the corner of his eyes, Johnny
studied the strangers. There were five heavily-built,
raw-boned fellows with dark skins and
thick lips. They were dressed merely in breech-clouts.
There were two small brown boys with
the squint eyes of Orientals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couple of Japs and their serfs,&rdquo; was his
mental comment.</p>
<p>Presently one of the Orientals dug from the
ashes of the fire two roasted sweet potatoes.
These he offered to the guests. After that he
supplied each member of his own group in the
same manner.</p>
<p>Johnny noticed that there was a little pile of
these potatoes on the beach, also two brown
hempen sacks full of some commodity. These
sacks were tied tightly at the top.</p>
<p>They ate the potatoes with great relish. After
that they were given water to drink.</p>
<p>When they at last attempted to engage the
strangers in conversation, they found them
quite incapable of understanding English.</p>
<p>Finally Pant, growing tired of the effort, rose
and strode down to the beach where the brown
sacks were lying. He thumped one of the sacks,
then lifted it from the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About a hundred pounds,&rdquo; he muttered.
Then, turning, he walked back to the group by
the fire. He had taken one hand from his
pocket. In its palm reposed a shiny ten dollar
gold piece. He pointed to the sack he had lifted,
then offered the gold to the smaller of the two
brown boys.</p>
<p>The boy reached out his hand and took it.</p>
<p>The act was repeated in reference to a second
gold piece and the remaining sack. This offer
was also accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know the value of gold all right,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;I have bought two hundred pounds of
rice. Let&rsquo;s get it on our backs. I think if we
cut right across beneath the palms here we will
about strike our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the sacks of rice on their shoulders, they
trudged on for a time in silence. At last Johnny
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we want of all this rice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three people can live a long time on two
hundred pounds of rice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>As he stepped out again into the moonlight
he gazed about him for a time, then in a musing
tone said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where we&rsquo;ll be to-morrow night.
It&rsquo;s going to work all right. The only question
is, how many miles do you get out of a hundred
pounds of rice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, after they had taken their
bearings, Pant said, &ldquo;Far as I can make out,
we&rsquo;re something like a hundred and fifty miles
from the wreck. Question is, will our fuel carry
us that far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fuel? What fuel?&rdquo; his two friends
echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Pant, &ldquo;we have some fuel&mdash;two
hundred pounds of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rice!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t
thought of using it for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps we&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; said Pant,
wrinkling his brow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all that stands between
us and starvation. Our brown friends
left the island last night. What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much carbon there
is in rice. Do either of you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>They both answered in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there you are,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;You see,
if we can&rsquo;t tell that, there is no way of guessing
how far two hundred pounds of rice will carry
us. It may let us down after we&rsquo;ve gone fifty
miles and clump us right into the ocean. And
the next time we may not be as fortunate as we
were this time in finding a safe harbor. Then
again, we might land safely in the lee of another
of these islands, only to find ourselves
without a single mouthful of food. So you see
there&rsquo;s something of a hazard in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor rose and began to pace back
and forth. He was very plainly agitated. For
fully five minutes he did not speak. Then he
turned to face the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The need of haste,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;is
great. Nothing in the world, it seems to me,
could be much more important. But you have
risked your lives for the cause; I will not press
you to do so again. You must decide for yourselves
whether we shall take the venture or not.
As for me, I am ready to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Pant and Johnny looked at one another. Pant
read Johnny&rsquo;s answer in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough.&rdquo; He sprang to his feet.
&ldquo;We go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-hour&rsquo;s time was consumed in grinding
a quantity of the rice, then they were away.
The remaining rice might be ground and fed
to the engines as they traveled.</p>
<p>Pant was again at the wheel. On his face
there was the strained look of one who constantly
listens for some dread sound. They
were flying low. Now and again his gaze
swept the sea. Twice he dropped to an even
lower level, as he fancied he caught the rush of
waters upon an unseen shore. Each time he
climbed back to their old level and they sped
steadily onward.</p>
<p>Fifty miles were recorded, then seventy-five.
A hundred stretched to a hundred and twenty-five.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Suddenly Pant&rsquo;s brow cleared. He climbed
to a higher level. The engines stopped all at
once. But this was because he had thrown back
the lever. As they glided silently down, there
came to them the old welcome sound of breakers.
Johnny Thompson, leaning far out of the
cabin, swept the sea with a pair of binoculars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the right,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land?&rdquo; asked the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An island; ours, I think. A rocky promontory
to the south, flat to the north, just as the
sailors described it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! We have made it!&rdquo; The Professor
brushed cold perspiration from his brow.
&ldquo;I was afraid&mdash;afraid of many things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motors were again started, only to be
shut off five minutes later. Then they began the
delightful circling journey which was to bring
them to a safe harbor and their goal. This time
there was no trying uncertainty; there was still
fuel in their tank and they knew something of
the place to which they were coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back and try for some sweet potatoes
in the morning. I think perhaps I&rsquo;ll find
another use for the rice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant did not answer. &ldquo;Funny bunch, those
brown boys,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t savvy English,
but they know Uncle Sam&rsquo;s money, all right.
It&rsquo;s that way all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island was very narrow. They soon
found themselves on the beach facing the bay
where the &ldquo;Dust Eater,&rdquo; as they called the seaplane,
was anchored.</p>
<p>It was decided that they should take turns at
the watch, three hours to the watch. This would
give each of them six hours of sleep and fit
them for whatever of fortune or misfortune lay
in their immediate future.</p>
<p>The Professor took the first watch, Pant the
second. Pant had hardly begun to pace the
beach on his watch when there sounded across
the waters the quick pop-pop-pop of a motor.
His first thought was of the &ldquo;Dust Eater,&rdquo; but
immediately he laughed at his fears; the popping
was made by a much less powerful motor
than those belonging to their seaplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>The sound came from toward the south end
of the island. Racing down the beach, tripping
over sand-brush and bits of drift here and
there, he managed to arrive in time to see the
tail-light of a motorboat fast disappearing out
on the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Orientals and their men!&rdquo; he exclaimed
disgustedly. &ldquo;It was stupid of us not to keep
track of them. They might have given us a lift
to the very island we&rsquo;re bound for. We were
too played out to think clearly, though, and now
they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked slowly back toward their camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; he thought to himself,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s time I was trying something else. I&rsquo;ll
get at it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at camp, he cut open one of the
large sacks of rice and poured a quart of it
in an aluminum kettle. Placing the kettle in the
bottom of the canvas boat, he shoved off and was
soon at the door of the cabin on the &ldquo;Dust
Eater.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>For a moment he paused to gaze about him.
He had never seen anything quite like the night
that lay spread out before him. The moon,
a great, yellow ball, hung high in the heavens;
the sea, now calm, lay sparkling in the moonlight,
while the palms shot skyward, a blue-black
fringe on the garment of night.</p>
<p>He had little time for such reveries, however.
There was work to be done.</p>
<p>Once inside the cabin, he took up a trapdoor
in its floor and, from the space beneath, drew
out a strange circular arrangement. To this
he attached wires running from a line of batteries
hung securely against the walls. He
next poured his quart of rice into a small hopper
at the top of the circular mechanism. There
came a snap-snap as he threw in a switch. A
whirling grinding sound followed. Presently,
from a small tube, there began to pour forth a
white powder, finer than the finest flour. This
he caught in the kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to work,&rdquo; he mumbled, as the white
pile in the bottom of the kettle grew to a sizable
cone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>When the machine gave forth a strange new
sound, as of a feed-mill running empty, he
snapped off the switch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Taking up the kettleful of white dust, he
walked back to the fuel tank of the plane, and,
with the aid of a funnel, poured in the powder.
After screwing on the top, he went back to his
old place at the wheel.</p>
<p>He pressed a button here, threw a lever forward
there, and at once there came the thunder
of a motor. Quickly he threw back the lever.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to wake them.&rdquo; He stood up and
peered shoreward.</p>
<p>Satisfied that his companions had not been
disturbed, he returned to the cabin and put
things to rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wreck&rsquo;s to the southeast,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;I can see it plainly. Look&rsquo;s queer, though; all
white, as if there had been a recent snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, as they circled lower, he
laughed and exclaimed: &ldquo;Sea-gulls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>It was true. The ship, but recently a staunch
sea-craft, had become a roost for sea-gulls.
Literally thousands of them rose screaming into
the air as the &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; gracefully glided
into the waters of the sheltered bay.</p>
<p>There is no mystery in all the world greater
than a deserted wreck. An old house, an abandoned
mill, a cabin in the forest, all these have
their charm of mystery, but the wreck of a ship,
laden with who knows what treasure, and abandoned
by her master, a wreck so remote from
inhabited lands that it has not been visited since
the night of its disaster, here was mystery
indeed.</p>
<p>So eager were they to board the craft that
they could scarcely wait until the plane had been
made fast and the canvas boat lowered.</p>
<p>One question troubled Johnny: The seamen,
taken from the wreck, had reported no native
inhabitants of the island, yet some might have
been hiding out in the rocky portion of the
place, for this island was some three times the
size of the island they had just left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>As he climbed up the rope ladder which still
dangled from her side, and sprang upon her
deck, slippery with guano deposited by the gulls,
he kept a sharp watch for any signs of depredation
done to the ship since she was deserted.
He found none, and no signs of life on the
main deck, but as he went down the hatch, he
fancied he discovered the faint mark of a bare
foot on one step.</p>
<p>Their first thought was of the four chests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your brother&rsquo;s berth on the main deck
or below?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell,&rdquo; said the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably main deck,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;but
you can&rsquo;t be sure. You take the larboard side
of the main deck, and, Pant, you take the starboard.
I&rsquo;ll go below and see what I can find.
Some of the staterooms will be locked. We can
search the open ones first, and pry the others
open later if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sprang down the hatchway, he fancied
he heard a sound from below. For a moment
he was tempted to turn back. Then with
&ldquo;Probably only a sea-gull,&rdquo; he dropped on down
and began making his way along a dark companionway.
He had not gone ten paces when
he heard a soft pat-pat of footsteps. The next
moment a sharp exclamation escaped his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>From the door of a stateroom had appeared
a brown head, then another and another.</p>
<p>Suddenly some object whizzed past his head,
to strike with a sickening spat in the wall behind
him. He did not need to be told it was a
knife.</p>
<p>The door of a stateroom stood open beside
him. Instinctively he sprang inside and
slammed it shut. He was not an instant too
soon, for a second knife struck the door. Such
force had been used in its throwing, so keen a
blade it had, that the point of it struck through
the wood the length of Johnny&rsquo;s little finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now what?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>And then he thought of his companions. How
was he to warn them before it was too late?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />THE MYSTERY DEEPENS</h2>
<p>For a single minute Johnny Thompson remained
behind the closed door; then his fear for
his companions drove him forth. Throwing the
door wide open, he made a dash for it. Down
the companionway and up the hatch he raced
at full speed.</p>
<p>The Professor was the first person he came
across.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pant?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Natives on
board&mdash;murderous fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; A black form appeared on deck.
&ldquo;Dodge!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny, setting the example.
&ldquo;They throw knives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed, however, that this precaution was
unnecessary, for the black man sprang to the
gunwale, then leaped overboard. He was followed
rapidly by two others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Pant had heard something of the commotion,
and now came hurrying around the corner of
a cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives,&rdquo; explained Johnny. &ldquo;Bad ones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get to the rifles,&rdquo; breathed Pant.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell how many of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped for the rope ladder. In another
minute they were rowing rapidly for the &ldquo;Dust
Eater.&rdquo; As Johnny climbed to the cabin on the
plane he looked back. &ldquo;There they go!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>It was true. A long, slender canoe, manned
by four husky native paddlers, was shooting
over the water at an incredible speed. They
were striking boldly out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they&rsquo;re as afraid of us as we are of
them,&rdquo; smiled Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think that&rsquo;s all of them?&rdquo; asked Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one more than I saw,&rdquo; answered
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came at a fortunate time,&rdquo; remarked
the Professor. &ldquo;They doubtless belong to another
island and have discovered the wreck in
passing. The whole tribe will be along presently
to loot it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better
work fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get away before they come,&rdquo; said Pant.
&ldquo;Good idea. Plenty of coal to grind up for
fuel. Perhaps we can get away before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After securing the rifles they hastened back
to complete their search, confident that the
treasure chests would be in their hands in short
order.</p>
<p>In a cabin formerly occupied by the chief
steward, Johnny found a master key, which expedited
their work. With his two companions
standing guard, Johnny was able to unlock one
stateroom after another in rapid succession.
One glance in each was enough to satisfy him
that the chests were not to be found there.</p>
<p>When they had made the entire rounds of
the main deck, and had discovered no chests
of any sort, their hopes fell a trifle. There remained,
however, the lower deck. To this they
hastened. When this search proved fruitless,
they stood for a minute silently looking at one
another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The hurricane deck!&rdquo; exclaimed the Professor.
&ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s cabin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thither they rushed. Here again they were
unrewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have happened?&rdquo; asked the
Professor in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he changed his mind and
shipped them as cargo, do you?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;yet
all things are possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that those natives carried
them off,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t in that canoe,&rdquo; objected Johnny.
&ldquo;Saw right into it. Wasn&rsquo;t a thing. Might
have hid them on shore, though. I suggest that
we go ashore and do a little searching, and prepare
some sort of meal. There&rsquo;s food down in
the galleys&mdash;canned stuff and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the Professor to keep watch, the two
boys hurried down below, to reappear a few
minutes later each with a dishpan full of cans,
jars and cartons of food of every description.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t starve, anyway,&rdquo; panted Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but whatever we do we&rsquo;ve got to
hurry,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;Those natives will be coming
back. Then there&rsquo;ll be no staying on the
island for us. Natives are all right when there
are plenty of white men about to make them be
good, but give them three white men and a shipload
of loot and them about a hundred strong,
then see how quickly the white men disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly they dumped their supplies into
the canvas boat, then paddled rapidly for the
shore. They were soon partaking of a hearty
meal as they sat upon the fallen trunk of a
giant palm in the shade of a delightfully cool
grove.</p>
<p>Johnny could scarcely finish his meal in his
eagerness to explore that region of the island
close to the shore. Before the others had finished
eating, he hastened around the end of the
grove and came out upon the shore close to an
out-jutting rocky cliff. At the base of this cliff
he paused in astonishment. Back a little from
the beach and against the end of the cliff was a
rude cabin built of drift-wreckage from the
ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>With much hesitation he approached the door
of the cabin, which was a real door taken from
the ship. &ldquo;Some white man; no native built
that,&rdquo; he murmured as he knocked on the door.</p>
<p>Getting no answer, he knocked again; this
time louder. Still no response. Having turned
the knob he was surprised to find that the door
was not locked. Pushing it back, he looked
within. Then, quickly closing it, he raced back
to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come see what I have found!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;There must be at least one survivor
of the wreck who did not escape with the ship&rsquo;s
crew. There is a cabin built of driftwood at
the end of the cliff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cabin! A cabin!&rdquo; exclaimed the others,
as they sprang up and prepared to follow him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>An inspection of the cabin convinced them
that it had been occupied for some time and had
been but recently abandoned, if, indeed, the
builder might not be expected back at any moment.
Some garments of an oriental design
hung upon the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;s a Chinaman?&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>There was a well-built bunk on one side of
the room, and on the opposite a wood-burning
stove improvised out of empty gasoline cans.
There was a small table, a ship&rsquo;s chair and a
box of dishes, also a handmade set of shelves
well stocked with ship supplies.</p>
<p>As the Professor rummaged about one corner
of the room his hand fell upon an object which
immediately absorbed his attention. For a few
minutes he stood staring at it. Then he whispered
to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it be possible? If it only were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the boys he said nothing, but Johnny saw
an unaccountable new light of hope in his eyes.
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if this man could have
discovered the chests and brought them ashore
for safe keeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wondering that myself,&rdquo; said
the Professor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth looking into.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, where is he?&rdquo; asked
Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives may have done for him,&rdquo; suggested
Johnny.</p>
<p>A cloud passed over the Professor&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;Let us hope not,&rdquo; he said quickly. After a
moment&rsquo;s thought, he added: &ldquo;We must search
the island thoroughly. We must find the chests
and that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said suddenly, drawing
an object from his pocket, &ldquo;that is the razor
I learned to shave with when a boy? It was my
father&rsquo;s&mdash;an old-styled one, called a &lsquo;pipe
razor.&rsquo; There was never a better made. I
found it in that shack just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys stared but asked no questions.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, while the Professor was
gone for a bucket of water, the boys held a
brief consultation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right to search the
island,&rdquo; said Johnny; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of
owning up we&rsquo;re beaten myself, but how about
those natives?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be pretty bad if they once land,&rdquo; said
Pant, &ldquo;but perhaps we can prevent them from
landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how. We couldn&rsquo;t attack them
before they had done us any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t, but there may be a way to
stop them. Time enough to think about that
once they come in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then there&rsquo;re those chaps who claim the
wreck belongs to them.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s gaze wandered
far out to sea, as if he expected to catch
sight of a coil of smoke drifting there. &ldquo;If
they weathered the storm, they&rsquo;ll soon be down
upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do anything about that, either, until
it happens,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, we&rsquo;ll take up the search. I
fancy the Professor will want to be one of the
searching party. Will you stay with the camp,
or shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Pant, a moment later, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s funny
about that razor he found!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Probably his brother had it on
board, and this sailor, or whoever he is, this
survivor, took it off and has been using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; said Pant in a skeptical tone of
voice. &ldquo;Seamen are very superstitious about
razors belonging to dead men, though.&rdquo; If he
thought any further along that line, he at least
said no more about it at that time.</p>
<p>Several hours later, just as the two searchers
were returning from a long and fruitless tramp
over the island, and were being cheered by the
odor of coffee boiling over an open fire, Pant
suddenly pointed to the open sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they come!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Low on the horizon there appeared three long,
low sailing vessels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives!&rdquo; said Johnny in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Pant; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s
more, we&rsquo;ve got to do something about it
quickly or they&rsquo;ll be swarming ashore with murder
in their eyes. We&rsquo;ve got to get to the
plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go along?&rdquo; asked Pant, pausing
to address the Professor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame you for seeking safety. As for myself,
I shall stay here until I have succeeded in proving
certain conclusions I have come to, or else
have disproved them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys rushed on down to the beach, then
pushing the canvas boat off, rowed rapidly toward
the &ldquo;Dust Eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Pant, &ldquo;that our professor
friend doesn&rsquo;t understand us very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I fear I don&rsquo;t understand this move
very well, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will shortly.&rdquo; They had arrived at the
seaplane. &ldquo;You take the wheel; I&rsquo;ll stay in the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though surprised that he should be requested
to fly the plane, Johnny asked no questions, but,
taking his place before the wheel, set the engines
in motion and soon found himself gliding out
over the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sail straight out over them,&rdquo; ordered Pant
through the tube, &ldquo;then hover there as best
you can. Not too high though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Johnny followed instructions and was soon
directly above the three large canoes. He could
see the natives plainly. There were twenty or
more of them in a canoe. Great, swarthy fellows
they were, dressed in all manner of apparel,
from a full suit of white duck to a mere
breech cloth. They were heavily armed.
Johnny was a little startled to note that many
of them carried rifles. The plane was not out
of range of a good rifle. The natives, apparently
stupefied at the appearance of this gigantic
bird, were staring upward, making no
movement. Even their paddles were idle.</p>
<p>Presently a wisp of smoke rose from one of
their canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Johnny thought to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The native nearest the spot leaped to one
side, and there were frantic efforts to quench
the little fire that had started in the side of the
boat. While this was being accomplished, however,
with all the natives bunched at that end
of the boat, a second fire broke out in the other
end of this canoe. This fire gained some headway
before it was discovered. The boat began
to leak. The natives flew into a panic. Some
of them leaped overboard and swam toward
the other canoes.</p>
<p>When a third blaze appeared in the boat a
panic followed. Every native in the canoe forsook
her. Plunging into the sea, they made
haste to reach the remaining boats.</p>
<p>Pant looked down with interest while the
burning boat, now in full blaze, sent flashes of
light across the water.</p>
<p>When the last survivor of this strange wreck
at sea was aboard the remaining boats, these
crafts turned rightabout. Every oar and paddle
was set doing double time to carry them
out of these mysterious and terrible waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing it happened,&rdquo; said Pant.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we could have trusted them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if the sample of knife-throwing they
gave me was any sign,&rdquo; Johnny replied. He
was greatly relieved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go back now and join the
Professor again in his search,&rdquo; said Pant.
&ldquo;Hope we can make it snappy, though. That
steamer&rsquo;ll be along any minute now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where those chests are,
and what&rsquo;s in them,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; settled down upon
the waters of the bay. A few minutes later
they were sitting about the fire, making plans
for the night&rsquo;s watch and the morning&rsquo;s renewal
of the search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clouding up. Looks like storm,&rdquo; said Pant
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope it doesn&rsquo;t bring those black boys back
to us,&rdquo; said Johnny, wrinkling his brow.</p>
<p>Before Johnny went to sleep he thought in
some wonder of one experience of that day, of
the burning of the native canoe. He could not
help but connect that up with other incidents:
the white fire in the factory and the burning of
the automobile in the desert. Had Pant been
at the bottom of all these things? If he had
been, what strange new power did he possess?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>After that he thought for a time of their
own problems. Would they ever return to the
factory to report the complete success of the
new steel and of the dust-burning engines?
And would he ever analyze the contents of that
vial in the factory laboratory? Of one thing
he was certain, and he smiled grimly as he
thought of it: they were not likely to be bothered
by their ancient enemy, the contortionist,
on this desert island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />A STRANGE LIFE BOAT</h2>
<p>It was night, a night of storm. The wind
had come sweeping in from the sea, bringing
rain and rolling waves. It was not a typhoon,
but a straight-on nor&rsquo;wester of great violence.
By the aid of an improvised capstan, the two
boys had dragged the &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; high up
on the beach, and, with ropes and wooden
stakes had guyed her there.</p>
<p>The storm was now at its height. The wind
set the dark clumps of palms swishing and
moaning in a dismal fashion. Great sheets of
rain beat against Johnny&rsquo;s face as, wrapped to
the chin in a slicker, he went from the cabin
close to the cliff where they had taken refuge,
down to the beach, to make sure that the guys
to the plane were holding firm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>When he had assured himself that all was
well, he paused for a moment to gaze out to
sea. He was half afraid that the two native
boats had not reached their harbor before the
storm broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping them off this island is one thing,
driving them into the teeth of a storm another;
wouldn&rsquo;t want to be responsible for their
deaths,&rdquo; he mumbled. Then he started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? A light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had come a lull in the storm. The
rain had ceased. It seemed to him that, as he
strained his eyes to gaze seaward, he made out
a light. Now appearing, now disappearing, it
seemed to be upon some craft bobbing up and
down with the waves that were rolling high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be the natives. No canoe could ride
this storm. It might be&mdash;&rdquo; This second
thought sent him hurrying across the beach toward
the cabin. His companions were asleep,
but this was important; he would waken them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking an awful risk,&rdquo; he explained
to Pant and the Professor, a few moments
later, as they stood upon the brow of the cliff
watching the now unmistakable light of a ship
out to sea. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too close in now for
safety. Shoals out there, and it seems to me
they&rsquo;re coming closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost their bearings,&rdquo; suggested Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think a beacon fire would help?&rdquo; asked
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably would only mislead them,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;Besides, I think it&rsquo;s rather too late.
Unless I mistake their position, they&rsquo;re due to
go aground any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With strained and expectant faces the three
stood watching the bobbing light. Now it
appeared, now it was lost to sight, but at each
new appearance it seemed to gleam more
brightly, as if coming nearer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>They were troubled by this new turn of affairs.
There could be little doubt but this was
the ship they had seen struggling in the grip
of the typhoon, the ship which had come to
dismantle the wreck. If she went aground, it
would be their duty to assist the unfortunate
sailors in every way possible, yet, in doing so,
they would doubtless be bringing disaster down
upon their own heads. These were rough, unscrupulous
men. They would at once suspect
the two boys and the Professor of treachery.
After that, what would happen? Who could
tell? Yet, they were men and, in time of disaster,
they must be given every assistance.</p>
<p>The three of them had scarcely thought this
through, each in his own way, when Johnny
exclaimed suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They caught their breath and waited. The
light had disappeared. For a moment they
looked in vain for it; then it reappeared, rose
higher than ever before, then hung gleaming
there like a fixed star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard aground!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And likely to break up at any minute,&rdquo;
answered Pant.</p>
<p>A moment later there burst out above the
ship a ball of fire, then another and another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sending up rockets,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;I wonder
how they expect to get aid from these desolate
shores? No ship could come near them
without going aground. No lifeboat could ride
such a sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;we must try to
give them assistance. If we don&rsquo;t there&rsquo;ll not
be a man of them alive by morning. Their ship
is out where the breakers are rolling strongest,
not sheltered by the point, as the Chinese ship
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;we must
render them some assistance, but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Dust Eater,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ride that sea, even if she could
the storm,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not work,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;but in
times like these, anything&rsquo;s worth trying.
C&rsquo;m&rsquo;on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hastened down to the beach where the
&ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; was straining at her moorings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and the Professor prop up the boat
and set the wheels under her, while I work at
something else,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>He rushed into the cabin of the &ldquo;Dust
Eater&rdquo; to return at once with two great balls
of stout hempen twine. This was a reserve
supply to be used for lashing the wings of
the plane in case of accident.</p>
<p>There were quantities of drift timber from
the wreck of the Chinese craft scattered about
on the beach. After gathering up several of
these, Johnny began splitting them into pieces
a foot in length and about the size of a broom
handle. These, as fast as he had split them, he
tied into one end of a ball of cord, leaving a
space of six or more feet between each two.
When he had worked at this for some time,
he at last turned to his companions.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; was supplied with a set
of starting wheels which might be attached to
the beam of her boatlike body. These were
for use only when an emergency made it necessary
to take a start-off from land. Such an
emergency was now at hand. Whether, with
the gale blowing, they would be able to make a
successful flight, remained to be seen. They
were now in a position to make the attempt,
for Pant and the Professor had completed
their task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now each of you go to a guy behind her
and loosen it, but do not let go,&rdquo; said Johnny.
He stepped forward and loosened the two in
front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a snub &rsquo;round a stake,&rdquo; he cautioned,
as an afterthought. &ldquo;Are you ready? There&rsquo;s
two balls of twine on the beach there. I&rsquo;ve
tied some sticks to one end of one of them.
The other end of that one is tied to an end of
the second one. I&rsquo;m taking the end with the
sticks on in with me. When we get away, Professor,
you must attempt to play the line out
to us as we fly. Don&rsquo;t let it break if you can
help it. We&rsquo;re going to try to take them a line.
They must have rope enough to reach shore,
and pulleys to make a flying car. We can get
them ashore if it works. Do you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>Johnny nodded approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Pant, give your guy rope to the
Professor. Keep it snubbed, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Pant, understanding his part, climbed into the
pilot&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Professor, ease away. Give her the
dust,&rdquo; he breathed to Pant.</p>
<p>The engine thundered. They were away
with the storm. A wild circle brought them
perilously near the cliff, but they missed it.</p>
<p>Johnny felt the slowly growing strain on the
cord and knew that the Professor was succeeding
with his task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right over her, if you can,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>The wind caught them, nearly dashing them
into the sea. The line tangled with the braces,
but Johnny managed to drag it free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now&mdash;right over!&rdquo; shouted Johnny.
The next moment he sent the wood-weighted
end of the cord whirling toward the ship. The
line burned his fingers, but he clung to it as it
played out.</p>
<p>It was a fortunate cast; almost a miracle,
was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment, for at once he
felt a tug on the cord such as mere water could
not give, and that instant he let go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help but find it,&rdquo; he told Pant
through the tube. &ldquo;Back to the island now.
It&rsquo;ll take all of us to draw their line in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a difficult landing. The beach was
narrow and none too long; the waves washing
it from end to end. Three times they soared
low, but did not dare attempt it. The fourth
time, driving straight against the wind, they
sank lower and lower, at last to feel the welcome
bump-bump on the sand. The next moment
they were out of the plane and guying her
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made it!&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s brief comment, as
they finished. &ldquo;Now for that line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant did not follow at once; he was looking
intently out to sea, where a light was blinking,
brightening, then dimming, then lighting up
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that?&rdquo; he shouted to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a signal. The message they sent says,
&lsquo;Haul away!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. That means they have our
line. We can&rsquo;t haul a heavy wet rope across
the water and up the cliff by hand; have to
have a capstan for that. Guess the one we
used this evening will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding the capstan, they dragged it up the
side of the cliff. Here they anchored it firmly.
Then began the task of pulling in the line. It
came in quite freely at first; Johnny was beginning
to think the cord had broken, when the
back-pull began to stiffen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em all right,&rdquo; he panted, as they redoubled
their efforts.</p>
<p>Fathom after fathom the line was reeled in.
So tight grew the strain that they felt sure it
must break. But it did not. Presently they
came to a knot and the end of a heavier line.</p>
<p>Attaching this to the capstan, they reeled in
rapidly until they came to the place where the
line was double, the added strand much larger
than the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big one&rsquo;s for the pulley to ride on; the
little one&rsquo;s to pull them in by,&rdquo; explained Pant.
&ldquo;Now, all together, let&rsquo;s draw her tight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Round and round went the capstan. Up&mdash;up&mdash;up
rose the dripping rope until, at last,
it swung entirely free from the sea.</p>
<p>Seizing a lantern, Pant alternately dimmed
and brightened it. This he repeated several
times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giving them the signal for O. K.,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>He then watched their light as it dimmed
and brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;&lsquo;Haul away.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time by hand they reeled in the smaller
cord. Length after length of it was drawn in
and coiled on the rocks. When, for a moment,
there was a heavy back-pull, they knew that
the men on the swaying rope-hung pulley had
been dipped beneath a giant wave. They redoubled
their efforts, and presently had the
pleasure of seeing five half-drowned men drop
down by a line from the pulley to the sandy
beach.</p>
<p>This time it was Pant&rsquo;s turn to signal
&ldquo;Heave away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>The signal was obeyed. The swinging car
was hauled back and loaded once more with
human freight.</p>
<p>This was repeated over and over again until
the last man was ashore. When this last man
cupped his hands and shouted up to them, &ldquo;All
safe,&rdquo; the two boys dropped down upon the
rocks exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny, after a time, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got them. Question is, what are we going to
do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely it is, &lsquo;What are they going
to do with us?&rsquo;&rdquo; grumbled Pant. &ldquo;There
are twenty or more of them to our three. Their
ship is a hopeless wreck. It will, half of it, be
on the beach in pieces by morning. We have
the only means of transportation. The only
way to leave the island is by plane. Question
is, what will they do about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, a serious situation. Johnny&rsquo;s
brow wrinkled as he took in the full significance
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go down and mingle with
them,&rdquo; he said, presently. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no better
way to judge of a man&rsquo;s character than by listening
to what he says in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the men rough and boisterous.
Some of them were smashing up all available
timber and building fires under the brow of the
cliff. Others had crowded the little cabin to an
unbearable degree.</p>
<p>Pant and Johnny crept into a dark corner
beneath the cliff and facing a blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty rough,&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s only comment.</p>
<p>Soon he became conscious of the presence of
a little man who appeared to stand aloof from
the others. He was a clean, decent appearing
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty close one,&rdquo; Johnny said, by way of
starting conversation.</p>
<p>The little man turned and gave him a sharp
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You from that airplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it was close.&rdquo; The man lowered his
voice. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave &rsquo;appened but they was
quarrelin&rsquo; over &rsquo;ow they&rsquo;d divide the plunder,
them officers was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plunder?&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; the sailor whispered.
&ldquo;That wreck don&rsquo;t belong to them. It
belonged to a company in China. The captain
of &rsquo;er fergot to set a line to &rsquo;er and attach it
to the shore, as is the law of the sea, so she&rsquo;s
fair salvage to those &rsquo;as gets to &rsquo;er first&mdash;just
plunder, I&rsquo;d call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they claimed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, so&rsquo;s no other ship wouldn&rsquo;t come
fer &rsquo;er. They was sharp ones, them officers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And worse than I thought,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Worse, did you say? They&rsquo;re a &rsquo;ard lot.
Know what they done to me? Shanghaied me,
they did. &rsquo;Ere I is in the &rsquo;arbor with no money
and no place to sleep, and they says to me,
&lsquo;Sleep in the ship. We can&rsquo;t sail fer four
days,&rsquo; an&rsquo; that night, up they &rsquo;eaves anchor and
out to sea they blows, an&rsquo; me a-sleepin&rsquo; sound.
That&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow they ships me. An&rsquo; no agreement
to pay &rsquo;er nothin&rsquo;. Say,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;if
they&rsquo;s a show-down, or anything, between you
and them, you count me in on your side. But
don&rsquo;t you fight them if you can &rsquo;elp it, fer, as I
say, they&rsquo;s a &rsquo;ard lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thanked him, then lay for a time listening
to the low murmur of voices. At last
he fell into a half-sleep from which he awakened
to find that day was breaking.</p>
<p>He scrambled down from the rocks to the
beach. There he met a short, broad-shouldered
man with beady rat-like eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Captain Hicks,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;That your seaplane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny answered, trying to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine plane. Luck, I call it. Our purser is
a licensed pilot. Soon&rsquo;s weather clears, I&rsquo;ll have
him take me over to another island in that
plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny gasped. He was about to protest.
Then the hopelessness of the situation came
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that he is accustomed
to handling all kinds of motors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knows &rsquo;em like a book,&rdquo; the captain chuckled
as he passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Pant, some time later,
when he had been told of the conversation,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager he&rsquo;ll have some difficulty in getting
old &lsquo;Dust Eater&rsquo; to perform for him. These
dust-eatin&rsquo; birds are particular who rides on
their backs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />THE CHESTS ARE FOUND</h2>
<p>The storm passed over with the rising sun;
the clouds scurried away, the wind went down,
and the sun set the ocean, the shore and the
tree-tops all aglitter with a million diamonds.
It seemed fortunate that there was to be no
prolonged uncertainty about the future, yet
the boys dreaded to face the conflict which
manifestly lay before them.</p>
<p>The beach was strewn with drift from the
lately wrecked vessel. Hardly a vestige of the
ship was left to mark the spot where it had
gone aground. The wreck of the Chinese ship,
however, was still standing, the point having
sheltered it from the force of the waves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Seamen were at once busy salvaging eatables
from the wreckage. Various barrels,
boxes and casks, containing beef, pilot-bread,
tea, coffee, cheese and like commodities, which
would prove invaluable if there was to be a
prolonged stay on the island, were piled on the
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you. Lend a hand,&rdquo; the captain
shouted to a knot of men.</p>
<p>The bay was quiet now. His purser, the
former air pilot, had had the landing-wheels
removed from the &ldquo;Dust Eater.&rdquo; They were
prepared to launch her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That captain is a rotter,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;He
and his purser would go off and leave us all
here to starve if they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very confident of his ability, the usurping
pilot took his place before the wheel as the
seamen prepared to shove the plane into the
water.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson had been looking on with
interest when, all at once, his eye was caught
by a stranger who had silently joined the group
that stood about. He wore an oriental costume,
yet he was a white man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Johnny started. At first he thought it was
the Professor who had garbed himself in the
clothing left in the cabin while his own clothing
dried. But instantly he knew he was wrong;
this man&rsquo;s face was too brown and too much
seamed to be that of the Professor.</p>
<p>Like a flash, the truth dawned upon him:
This was the Professor&rsquo;s brother. He had not
been drowned at the time of the wreck of the
Chinese ship, but had, somehow, saved himself
after the others had been picked up by the passing
steamer. It had been he who had built the
cabin by the cliff. That explained the presence
of the razor in the cabin. It explained, too, the
mystery of the missing chests; he had brought
them ashore and had hidden them somewhere
on the island.</p>
<p>He had been hiding out, but, on seeing the
ship wrecked the previous night, had doubtless
decided to cast his lot with these marooned
men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>He did not have long to wait for the proof
that at least some of these conclusions were
correct, for almost instantly the Professor,
turning, saw the stranger. For a second his
face went white and he seemed about to fall.
He recovered himself and sprang forward, and
the two men embraced one another, like two
children who had been a long time separated.</p>
<p>But now Johnny&rsquo;s attention was attracted by
a suppressed laugh from the men about him,
who had been watching the new pilot in his
attempt to start the &ldquo;Dust Eater.&rdquo; As he
looked, he saw that the man&rsquo;s face was as black
as it might have been had he smeared it with
burnt cork.</p>
<p>What had happened was that having attempted
to start the engine, and having failed,
he had climbed back to the fuel tank and there
had unscrewed the top, thinking to see if there
was gasoline in it. In attempting to look inside,
he had put his face too close to the opening,
had blown into it, and the feathery coal
dust with which the boys had filled the tank
had risen up in a cloud to besmirch his damp
visage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The purser was in a fine rage. He ordered
the sailor who had rowed him out to the &ldquo;Dust
Eater&rdquo; in the canvas boat to take him ashore.
Once his feet touched the beach, he came racing
toward Johnny and Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave this to me,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;You and
the Professor quietly drop out of the bunch,
and then make your way to the north end of
the island as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly said this than the purser was
upon him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart trick!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d
balk us. Took out the gasoline and filled the
tank with coal dust!&rdquo; He seemed about to
strike Pant.</p>
<p>With a tiger-like spring, Pant leaped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not.&rdquo; His voice was low, like the
warning hiss of a panther.</p>
<p>The purser hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something,&rdquo; Pant said
evenly. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a drop of gasoline on
this island as far as I know; not a drop in that
plane, either, but all the same, she&rsquo;ll fly for a
man who understands her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You
come over to the plane with me. Look her all
over. See if there is any gasoline on her.
Then you let me try to get her going. See if
I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The other man&rsquo;s smile showed
his incredulity.</p>
<p>Together in the canvas boat they went out
to the plane. Carefully the purser looked the
plane over, then expressing himself satisfied
that there was no gasoline on board, he seated
himself carelessly astride the fuselage, and with
a mock-smile, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s see you start her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant dropped silently into his seat. This
was his chance. If he could make a clean get-away
all would be well. Johnny and the Professor
would be waiting at the north end of the
island. He would pick them up and they would
fly away. They would report the wreck of the
steamer at the nearest port and leave the rest
to the American consul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Catching a quick breath, he touched a button,
then pulled a lever. At once the engine
thundered. They were moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a little quick work,&rdquo; he whispered to
himself.</p>
<p>He whirled about, and with one swing of his
powerful arm pitched the astonished purser
from the fuselage into the sea. The next instant
the plane rose gracefully from the water.
He was away.</p>
<p>The purser came up sputtering, to swim for
the shore. The captain roared at Pant, commanding
him in the name of all things he knew
to stop. Bullets from a seaman&rsquo;s rifle sang
over his head, but all these arguments were
lost on him. He was on his way.</p>
<p>Taking a wide circle, that he might give his
companions time to arrive at the meeting-place,
he at last swung back to the end of the island.</p>
<p>To his surprise, as he eased the plane down
into the water, he saw, not two men, but four,
awaiting him. Besides his two companions,
there was the Professor&rsquo;s brother and the little
shanghaied English sailor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>There was no time for demanding and receiving
explanations; not even when he saw
four large chests piled on the rocky shore did
Pant ask a question. The canvas boat had been
fastened to the &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo;; it was still
there. Righting this, he pulled for the shore.
The chests were quickly tied together, and the
men loaded into the boat. Then, with the line
of chests following in their wake, they pulled
back to the plane.</p>
<p>The lashing of the chests, two back and two
before the cabin, consumed time. When this
was done, Pant tumbled into his seat, the other
four piled, pell-mell, into the cabin; the motors
thundered and they were away.</p>
<p>They were not a moment too soon, for the
captain, suspecting the move, had ordered his
men to race to the end of the island. Just as
the &ldquo;Dust Eater&rdquo; rose, graceful as a swan, out
of the water, the first man appeared at the top
of the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close one!&rdquo; grumbled Pant through the
tube.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough now, though,&rdquo; sighed Johnny.</p>
<p>Their journey to a port on the largest island
of the scattered group was made in safety.
The wreck was reported; then the &ldquo;Dust
Eater&rdquo; was loaded aboard a steamer bound for
San Francisco. They were to have a safer if
not a more eventful journey home.</p>
<p>It was only after the four chests had been
safely stowed away in a large stateroom aboard
the steamer that Johnny and Pant were let into
the secret of their contents. Then, with his
brother by his side, the medical missionary unlocked
one of the chests and lifted the lid.</p>
<p>The two boys leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>What they saw first was nothing more than
sawdust. The missionary put his hand into
this sawdust, and drew out a half-gallon can.
This can had a small screw top. This he took
off, and, having poured a little of the contents
into the palm of his hand, held it out for the
boys&rsquo; inspection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny in surprise. &ldquo;Do
you mean to tell us that we have gone through
all this to save four chests of oil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; said the Professor quickly.
&ldquo;This is no ordinary oil. It is Russian napthalan.
It is worth at the present moment, a
dollar and a half an ounce. There are sixty-four
ounces in that can, seventy-five cans to
the chest, and four chests. Figure for yourself
its value. But money,&rdquo; he went on in a
very serious tone, &ldquo;is not the principal reward.
It never is. There are in America today tens
of thousands of children suffering from a terrible
skin disease. They have no relief. A
salve, of which this oil is the base, will at once
relieve their condition, and in time will cure
them. To save these children, is this not a cause
for which one might gladly risk his life many
times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Johnny with conviction. &ldquo;I am
glad we came.&rdquo; In this expression he was
quickly seconded by Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Later that evening, after the moon had
spread a long yellow streamer across the
waters, Johnny and Pant sat in steamer chairs
side by side silently gazing across the sea.
Each was busy with his own thoughts. Johnny
was going over the events of the past few
months. In these months many mysteries had
leaped out of the unknown to stare him in the
face and challenge his wits to find their answers.
Some had been solved; others remained
yet to be solved. There was the white fire of
the factory which had worked such wonders
with steel and, closely associated with that,
were the fires that had started, apparently
without cause, on the red racer in the desert
and the savages&rsquo; canoe. These remained mysteries,
as did the problem of the composition
of the new steel. He wondered still if the vial
he had put away on the upper shelf of the laboratory
in the factory could possibly add some
light to this problem.</p>
<p>Of two things he was certain: The dust-burning
motor was a complete success and the
blue steel was the most marvelous steel ever
invented. He hoped that Pant and he would
not now be long in revealing these facts to
those most interested. They would delight the
heart of their employer and would bring great
joy to the aged inventor of the motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>First, though, they must return from the
coast to the factory with their machine. He
hoped that, by this time, they had succeeded in
shaking the contortionist off their trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never can tell,&rdquo; he whispered to
himself.</p>
<p>As if his mind had been working on these
very problems, Pant said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the boat rigging off the &lsquo;Dust
Eater&rsquo; when we reach the Golden Gate and rig
her up with landing wheels. Then we&rsquo;ll fly
home. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the best plan,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll give the motors one more try-out and
us another thrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he known the kind of thrill it was going
to be, he would doubtless have favored shipping
the plane by freight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />A RACE IN MID-AIR</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was happy; he thought he
had never been so happy in his life. They were
on their last lap home. The flight over the
Rockies and across the Great American Desert,
then over the vast prairies, had been accomplished
with ease and pleasure. In a few hours
they would be dropping down to the landing
field at the factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope the inventor has come to himself
enough to tell them the secret formula,&rdquo;
he mumbled to himself. He was thinking of
the new process steel and again, for the hundredth
time, the vial in the laboratory flashed
through his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I should have told them,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;Might be something in it. Might be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s signal at the speaking tube broke in
on his reflections.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plane to our larboard aft,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Big
blue one with wide planes. Looks like a racer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started. What plane could this be?
They were not in a region frequented by airplanes,
nor in the path of an air mail line. But
then, he reassured himself, planes were common
enough the country over.</p>
<p>He could not, however, shake off at once the
sense of fear that gripped him. He had not
forgotten their mad race across the desert, nor
his narrow escape on the mountain lake. A
race in an airplane might not end happily, especially
with him at the wheel.</p>
<p>His mind became at ease presently, and he
again took up the thread of thought that had
been broken off. Should this day&rsquo;s work be
completed in safety, their days of thrills and
dangers would, for a time at least, be over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seem to be following us,&rdquo; broke in Pant
again. &ldquo;Man, but they&rsquo;ve got some speed!
Let her out a notch or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>The plane seemed fairly to leap from beneath
them as Johnny, obeying instructions, &ldquo;let her
out.&rdquo; She was a good, substantial plane, of
the type that is destined to become the express-carrier
of tomorrow, but she was not of the
fastest model.</p>
<p>Johnny risked a glance back. Pant seemed
to be fumbling at something near his belt beneath
his heavy leather coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were only up here at the wheel!&rdquo;
Johnny groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop down a few hundred feet,&rdquo; suggested
Pant. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s necessary, we might make a
landing.&rdquo; Johnny tilted her nose groundward.</p>
<p>As they came closer to earth, they realized at
once that a landing was impossible; they were
passing over range after range of low, rolling
hills. There were no valleys to the crooked
streams that flowed between the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot her up again; better traveling,&rdquo; suggested
Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>It seemed to Johnny that he could catch the
thundering throb of the other plane&rsquo;s engine.
But this was only imagination. Truth was,
however, that the other plane was gaining on
them. Yard by yard they came closer. As the
miles sped from beneath them, the distance diminished.
Now they were a mile away; now
three-quarters. And now they plunged into a
great mass of white mist, which was a cloud,
and were for a time lost to view.</p>
<p>As they came again into clear sky, Johnny
gasped. The other plane appeared to have
doubled her speed. It could be only a matter
of moments now. What mad thing did those
fellows mean to attempt? Did they hope to
force them to the ground? Would they ram
them? To do so seemed certain death to all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got parachutes!&rdquo; shouted Pant
through the tube.</p>
<p>Parachutes? Johnny&rsquo;s mind was in a panic.
Perhaps they meant to take to their parachutes
after ramming the &ldquo;Dust Eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s voice was even and composed,
&ldquo;just slow her up a bit and hold her in
a steady, straight line.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up!&rdquo; Was Pant mad? The other
plane must be all but upon them! Without
question he obeyed. Straight as a chalk line
they shot on through the blue.</p>
<p>One minute, two, three, four, five. As
Johnny counted them on the dial of the clock
in front of him, he expected at any one of
them to feel a sudden shock.</p>
<p>But the shock did not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are,&rdquo; he heard Pant breathe at last.
&ldquo;No, I think you might circle a bit. Looks
like we&rsquo;re over a meadow. Not a bad landing-place.
They&rsquo;ve taken to their parachutes.
Their plane&rsquo;s on fire, but she&rsquo;ll carry on a mile
or two before she drops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their plane&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo; Pant had said it
in such a composed tone of voice that one
might think it quite the thing to expect at this
juncture.</p>
<p>Glancing back, Johnny saw him struggling to
replace something beneath his leather coat. It
looked like a long black leather case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>With trembling hands he set the plane to
circle downward, to follow the burning plane,
which was now careening wildly. Some two
miles back the two parachutes of the others,
white specks against the blue, were nearing the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have a look at their plane and be
away again before they arrive,&rdquo; suggested
Pant. &ldquo;Their fuselage is of sheet-steel. It
won&rsquo;t burn. There may be something of interest
in the seat or somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not fully approve of this maneuver.
Yet, since Pant was in charge of this
expedition, he proceeded to put the suggestion
into execution.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I found in that plane.&rdquo; Pant
drew some jagged bits of rusty metal from a
canvas bag. It was four hours after the burning
of the blue racer. The two boys had made
a landing near the wreck, and Pant had hurried
over there, to return with two objects
which he found in the seat: a canvas sack and
a pair of gloves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>They were now safe on the landing-field of
the factory. They were &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Their
journey and its dangers at an end, they were
resting on the grass for a few moments before
going to report to their employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all there is left of the bar of new
process steel they made away with. They tried
to work it by heating it in the usual way, and
failed. They found out some way that we were
trying out some parts made of the steel, and
were all for running us down and taking it
away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny examined the bits of metal carefully.
&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these gloves,&rdquo; said Pant, holding the
pair up for inspection, &ldquo;establish the identity
of the driver of the blue racer. No one but
your friend, the contortionist, the frog-man,
could wear such long-fingered affairs as these.
I suppose,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that we
could have the sheriff out in that country hunt
those fellows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a case would we have on
them, though?&rdquo; smiled Johnny. &ldquo;The sky&rsquo;s
all free property up to date, isn&rsquo;t it? You can&rsquo;t
have a fellow arrested for following you, can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; Pant reluctantly admitted.
&ldquo;Well, anyway, we got their machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; said Johnny suddenly, &ldquo;you set that
airplane on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Pant started and stared. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he said after a few seconds, &ldquo;what if I did?
Didn&rsquo;t do it until they had shown they were
planning to run us down, and then, not until I
knew they had parachutes. That was all right,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was all right,&rdquo; smiled Johnny. &ldquo;It
was more than all right&mdash;it was good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time the two were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You set their auto on fire back in the desert,
too,&rdquo; Johnny resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masked look that appeared to hide Pant&rsquo;s
face faded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, Johnny. Just because
you&rsquo;re such a good pal I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>Detaching from his belt the black leather
case, which Johnny had seen twice before, he
walked to the plane and, after attaching two
wires, started the motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the grass over there a hundred
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the ground began to smoke, and a
patch of grass turned to brown, then black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly rips up the ground, she does,&rdquo; Pant
said with a proud grin. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece of
gas pipe somebody&rsquo;s left sticking up in the
ground over there about three hundred feet.
Watch that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny watched with popping eyes while a
foot of the pipe turned first red, then intensely
white, then toppled over like a weed in a forest
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; he said breathlessly, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know myself,&rdquo; Pant smiled, as
he shut off the motor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of
things like it. X-ray, violet-ray, radium and
the like, you know. But this is something I
got up myself&mdash;sort of a cross between fire
and lightning, near&rsquo;s I can find out. I&rsquo;m having
it patented, though for the life of me I
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;d use it for. You can&rsquo;t
go around the world setting autos and planes
on fire when they come up behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;is the white
fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! I got a lot of fun out of that
business in the factory. Fooled you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and helped us a lot. That&rsquo;s why you
didn&rsquo;t stay about when the manager was with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was. I had to go back and get the
show going.&rdquo; Pant threw back his head and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Johnny, rising and stretching,
&ldquo;guess we&rsquo;d better go in and make our report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to you,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run
over and see if my patent papers are at the
postoffice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; said Mr. McFarland, a half-hour
later, as Johnny sat by the desk in his
private office, &ldquo;are a couple of papers you might
be interested in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>The instant he had them in his hand Johnny
recognized his father&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notes,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re
marked &lsquo;Paid in full.&rsquo; I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remember,&rdquo; said the manager,
struggling against a huskiness in his voice,
&ldquo;that your banker told you he held notes
against your father. He never told you who
the real owner was. He was acting according
to orders in doing this. I was the real owner,
and now&mdash;since you have rendered a service
to our company which more than balances the
account&mdash;I am giving them to you marked
&lsquo;Paid in full.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mind whirled. His good fortune
seemed too good to be believed. His debt of
honor was canceled. He might face the world
with a clean start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion,&rdquo; said the magnate.
&ldquo;It is a plain business proposition&mdash;value for
value received.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may be pleased to know,&rdquo; he hurried
on, glad to change the subject, &ldquo;that we found
a glass bottle left in the laboratory by the inventor,
that tells us what the new element in the
steel is. We have also discovered a method of
heat treatment which enables us to work the
metal. We are now in a position to manufacture
engines and utilize this new steel. It will
be worth millions, and the inventor, who is
slowly recovering, will receive his share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was experiencing strange sensations.
&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he managed to ask, &ldquo;did you find the
bottle which gave you the secret of the formula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upper shelf; right-hand corner; central
laboratory. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For no reason,&rdquo; said Johnny, a queer smile
playing about his lips, &ldquo;except that I guess I
was the fellow who put that bottle there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then explained how he had made the test
at night, to help keep himself awake, and how
he had not dared to reveal the results for fear
of being censured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>They had a good laugh over it, and at the
end Mr. McFarland said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that you may have the chummy
roadster which you and Pant drove so far.
And, by the way, send Pant to me. He must
have some reward. How do you think he&rsquo;d
like the plane you drove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he&rsquo;d like that O. K.,&rdquo; smiled Johnny.
&ldquo;Thanks for the car. If you&rsquo;ll allow me, I
should like to use it driving back and forth
from your factory to the School of Engineering.
I&rsquo;d like to spend a half day in each place.
There are a lot of things I need to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A splendid idea!&rdquo; said Mr. McFarland.
And at that Johnny bowed himself out.</p>
<p>A half hour later he and Pant sat drinking
coffee and munching doughnuts in the small
kitchen of the aged inventor of the dust-burning
motor. They were telling their story to
the delighted old couple. And that story, better
than mere assurance, informed them that
the invention was a huge success and that they
were rich. No other pleasure could have so fittingly
crowned this series of adventures than
did this simple story-telling to two old people
who appreciated it all as no others could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Johnny stuck to his purpose of attending the
engineering school. He learned there many of
the secrets of science and industry. The time
soon came, too, when he might put his knowledge
to work. For, one day, he received a wire
from Pant, who was again on the Pacific coast
with the &ldquo;Dust Eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come at once,&rdquo; the telegram ran. &ldquo;Need
you. Big new sea mystery. Will explain on
arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What that mystery was and how they solved
it must be told in our next volume of mystery
and adventure, &ldquo;The Black Schooner.&rdquo;</p>
